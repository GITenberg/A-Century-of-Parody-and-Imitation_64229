<h2><b>PREFATORY NOTE</b></h2></div>


<p>The object of this compilation is to provide a corpus of representative
parodies and imitations of a century, beginning with <i>Rejected
Addresses</i> (1812), which practically marked the birth of modern parody,
and are here printed in their entirety. Prose parodies, excepting those
in <i>Rejected Addresses</i>, have been excluded; the derivation of the word
'parody' may be referred to in justification. Emerson wrote in his
'Fable'</p>

  <div class="poetry-container">
    <div class="poetry">
      <div class="stanza">
        <div class="ileft">'&mdash;&mdash;all sorts of things and weather</div>
        <div>Must be taken in together</div>
        <div>To make up a year</div>
        <div>And a sphere;</div>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>

<p class="p-left">so in this volume will be found all forms of imitations from, in Mr.
Owen Seaman's words, 'the lowest, a mere verbal echo, to the highest,
where it becomes a department of pure criticism.'</p>

<p>It is quite unnecessary to add to the published mass of writing, wise
and foolish, on the art and ethics of parody. Some of the pieces in
this book are included chiefly because they have an historical place in
the development of parody to its present high standard of execution and
good taste.</p>

<p>Isaac D'Israeli asserted that 'unless the prototype is familiar to us a
parody is nothing.' As a matter of fact some of the best work is that
of which the originals have been forgotten long since; although, of
course, when the poets and the poems imitated are familiar the art of
the imitator can be better appreciated.</p>

<p>The word 'century' has been interpreted with some licence. The work of
living parodists does not fall<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">[vi]</a></span> within the scope of this collection,
and it is a real self-denying ordinance which forbids the inclusion
of triumphs by Sir Frederick Pollock, Mr. Owen Seaman, Sir Arthur
Quiller-Couch, Mr. Barry Pain, the Rev. Anthony Deane, and others who,
in their undergraduate days, enlivened the periodicals of Oxford and
Cambridge, or to-day show their dexterity in the pages of <i>Punch</i>. By
way of recompense, the volume contains parodies by some, still living
in 1812, whose work was published before <i>Rejected Addresses</i>. The
parodies which follow therefore range from George Ellis, who was born
in 1753, to Andrew Lang, who died in 1912. Very sparing use has been
made of anonymous work, and in this connexion it may be well to explain
that 'Adolphus Smalls of Boniface' is ruled out, because, although
published anonymously, it is known to be the joint composition in their
Balliol days of Dr. W. W. Merry, the Rector of Lincoln College, Oxford,
and Alfred Blomfield, afterwards Bishop of Colchester.</p>

<p>With regard to <i>Rejected Addresses</i>, the publication of which may be
said to have revived and established the art of parody, the genesis
of the work is sufficiently explained in the authors' prefaces and
notes. There were parodists before the Brothers Smith, yet their
topical little volume has a lasting value, not only because of its
inherent excellence, but also because it struck the note which the
best later exponents of the art have followed. Published in the autumn
of 1812, the book reached its fifteenth edition within two years,
and its success led to the publication of a volume of certain of the
<i>Addresses</i> that had really been sent to Drury Lane for competition.
The one hundred and fifteen such Addresses which were actually
submitted are, with one or two exceptions, preserved in the Manuscript
Department of the British Museum.</p>

<p>The compilers' best thanks are due to those who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vii" id="Page_vii">[vii]</a></span> have kindly allowed
the use of copyright parodies or imitations&mdash;namely, to the following:
Sir Herbert Stephen (and Messrs. Bowes and Bowes) for parodies by his
brother J. K. Stephen; Mr. Theodore Watts-Dunton and Messrs. Chatto
and Windus for Swinburne's parodies; Mr. W. M. Rossetti and Messrs.
Ellis for those by Dante Gabriel Rossetti; Messrs. G. Bell and Sons
for the copyright pieces by C. S. Calverley in <i>Fly-Leaves</i>; Messrs.
Blackwood and Sons for Sir Theodore Martin's 'Lay of the Lovelorn' and
H. D. Traill's parodies; Messrs. Bradbury, Agnew and Co. for R. F.
Murray's 'Tennysonian Fragment' from <i>Punch</i>; Messrs. Burns and Oates
for Francis Thompson's imitation of Omar Khayyam; Messrs. Chatto and
Windus, and, for the American rights, the Houghton, Mifflin Company,
for the parodies by Bret Harte and Bayard Taylor; the Editor of the
<i>Journal of Education</i> for 'A Girtonian Funeral' by an unknown author,
presumably deceased; Messrs. Longmans, Green and Co. for the parodies
by Andrew Lang; Messrs. J. MacLehose and Sons for the additional pieces
by R. F. Murray; Messrs. Metcalfe and Co. for A. G. Hilton's parodies;
Messrs. Pickering and Chatto for Miss Fanshawe's pieces; and Messrs.
Charles Scribner's Sons for the variations by H. C. Bunner on the
familiar theme of 'Home, Sweet Home.' The sources of the copyright work
are given in the notes at the end of the volume. The footnotes are
those of the writers of the parodies.</p>

<p class="left1">To the gewgaw fetters of <i>rhyme</i> (invented by the monks to enslave
the people) I have a rooted objection. I have therefore written an
address for your theatre in plain, homespun, yeoman's <i>prose</i>; in the
doing whereof hope I am swayed by nothing but an <i>independent</i> wish to
open the eyes of this gulled people, to prevent a repetition of the
dramatic <i>bamboozling</i> they have hitherto laboured under. If you like
what I have done, and mean to make use of it, I don't want any such
<i>aristocratic</i> reward as a piece of plate with two griffins sprawling
upon it, or a <i>dog</i> and a <i>jackass</i> fighting for a ha'p'worth of <i>gilt
gingerbread</i>, or any such Bartholomew-fair nonsense. All I ask is,
that the door-keepers of your playhouse may take all the <i>sets of my
Register</i> now on hand, and <i>force</i> every body who enters your doors to
buy one, giving afterwards a debtor and creditor account of what they
have received, <i>post-paid</i>, and in due course remitting me the money
and unsold Registers, <i>carriage-paid</i>.</p>

<p class="smcap">Most Thinking People,</p>

<p class="p-left">When persons address an audience from the stage, it is usual, either
in words or gesture, to say, 'Ladies and Gentlemen, your servant.'
If I were base enough,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span> mean enough, paltry enough, and <i>brute
beast</i> enough, to follow that fashion, I should tell two lies in a
breath. In the first place, you are <i>not</i> Ladies and Gentlemen, but
I hope something better, that is to say, honest men and women; and
in the next place, if you were ever so much ladies, and ever so much
gentlemen, I am not, <i>nor ever will be</i>, your humble servant. You
see me here, <i>most thinking people</i>, by mere chance. I have not been
within the doors of a playhouse before for these ten years; nor, till
that abominable custom of taking money at the doors is discontinued,
will I ever sanction a theatre with my presence. The stage-door is
the only gate of <i>freedom</i> in the whole edifice, and through that I
made my way from Bagshaw's<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> in Brydges Street, to accost you. Look
about you. Are you not all comfortable? Nay, never slink, mun; speak
out, if you are dissatisfied, and tell me so before I leave town. You
are now, (thanks to <i>Mr. Whitbread</i>,) got into a large, comfortable
house. Not into a <i>gimcrack palace</i>; not into a <i>Solomon's temple</i>; not
into a frost-work of Brobdingnag filigree; but into a plain, honest,
homely, industrious, wholesome, <i>brown brick playhouse</i>. You have been
struggling for independence and elbow-room these three years; and who
gave it you? Who helped you out of Lilliput? Who routed you from a
rat-hole, five inches by four, to perch you in a palace? Again and
again I answer, <i>Mr. Whitbread</i>. You might have sweltered in that place
with the Greek name<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> till doomsday, and neither <i>Lord Castlereagh</i>,
<i>Mr. Canning</i>, no, nor the <i>Marquess Wellesley</i>, would have turned a
trowel to help you out! Remember that. Never forget that. Read it to
your children, and to your children's children! And now, <i>most thinking
people</i>, cast your eyes over my head to what the builder (I beg his
pardon, the architect) calls the <i>proscenium</i>. No motto, no slang, no
popish Latin, to keep the people in the dark. No <i>veluti in speculum</i>.
Nothing in the dead languages, properly so called, for they ought to
die, aye and be <i>damned</i> to boot! The Covent Garden manager tried<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
that, and a pretty business he made of it! When a man says <i>veluti in
speculum</i>, he is called a man of letters. Very well, and is not a man
who cries O. P. a man of letters too? You ran your O. P. against his
<i>veluti in speculum</i>, and pray which beat? I prophesied that, though
I never told any body. I take it for granted, that every intelligent
man, woman, and child, to whom I address myself, has stood severally
and respectively in Little Russell Street, and cast their, his, her,
and its eyes on the outside of this building before they paid their
money to view the inside. Look at the brick-work, <i>English Audience</i>!
Look at the brick-work! All plain and smooth like a quakers' meeting.
None of your Egyptian pyramids, to entomb subscribers' capitals. No
overgrown colonnades of stone, like an alderman's gouty legs in white
cotton stockings, fit only to use as rammers for paving Tottenham Court
Road. This house is neither after the model of a temple in Athens, no,
nor a <i>temple</i> in <i>Moorfields</i>, but it is built to act English plays
in; and, provided you have good scenery, dresses, and decorations, I
daresay you wouldn't break your hearts if the outside were as plain as
the pikestaff I used to carry when I was a sergeant. <i>Apropos</i>, as the
French valets say, who cut their masters' throats<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a>&mdash;<i>apropos</i>, a
word about dresses. You must, many of you, have seen what I have read
a description of, Kemble and Mrs. Siddons in Macbeth, with more gold
and silver plastered on their doublets than would have kept an honest
family in butcher's meat and flannel from year's end to year's end! I
am informed, (now mind, I do not vouch for the fact,) but I am informed
that all such extravagant idleness is to be done away with here. Lady
Macbeth is to have a plain quilted petticoat, a cotton gown, and a
mob cap (as the court parasites call it;&mdash;it will be well for them,
if, one of these days, they don't wear a <i>mob cap</i>&mdash;I mean a <i>white
cap</i>, with a <i>mob</i> to look at them); and Macbeth is to appear in an
honest yeoman's drab coat, and a pair of black calamanco breeches. Not
<i>Sal</i>amanca; no, nor <i>Talavera</i> neither, my most Noble Marquess; but
plain, honest, black calamanco<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span> stuff breeches. This is right; this is
as it should be. <i>Most thinking people</i>, I have heard you much abused.
There is not a compound in the language but is strung fifty in a rope,
like onions, by the Morning Post, and hurled in your teeth. You are
called the mob; and when they have made you out to be the mob, you
are called the <i>scum</i> of the people, and the <i>dregs</i> of the people. I
should like to know how you can be both. Take a basin of broth&mdash;not
<i>cheap soup, Mr. Wilberforce</i>&mdash;not soup for the poor, at a penny a
quart, as your mixture of horses' legs, brick-dust, and old shoes, was
denominated&mdash;but plain, wholesome, patriotic beef or mutton broth; take
this, examine it, and you will find&mdash;mind, I don't vouch for the fact,
but I am told&mdash;you will find the dregs at the bottom, and the scum at
the top. I will endeavour to explain this to you: England is a large
<i>earthenware pipkin</i>; John Bull is the <i>beef</i> thrown into it; taxes
are the <i>hot water</i> he boils in; rotten boroughs are the <i>fuel</i> that
blazes under this same pipkin; parliament is the <i>ladle</i> that stirs the
hodge-podge, and sometimes&mdash;&mdash;. But, hold! I don't wish to pay <i>Mr.
Newman</i><a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> a second visit. I leave you better off than you have been
this many a day: you have a good house over your head; you have beat
the French in Spain; the harvest has turned out well; the comet keeps
its distance;<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> and red slippers are hawked about in Constantinople
for next to nothing; and for all this, <i>again and again</i> I tell you,
you are indebted to <i>Mr. Whitbread</i>!!!</p>

swelling opening is too often succeeded by an insignificant conclusion.
Parturient mountains have ere now produced muscipular abortions; and
the auditor who compares incipient grandeur with final vulgarity
is reminded of the pious hawkers of Constantinople, who solemnly
perambulate her streets, exclaiming, 'In the name of the Prophet&mdash;figs!'</p>

<p>Of many who think themselves wise, and of some who are thought wise
by others, the exertions are directed to the revival of mouldering
and obscure dramas; to endeavours to exalt that which is now rare
only because it was always worthless, and whose deterioration, while
it condemned it to living obscurity, by a strange obliquity of moral
perception constitutes its title to posthumous renown. To embody the
flying colours of folly, to arrest evanescence, to give to bubbles
the globular consistency as well as form, to exhibit on the stage
the piebald denizen of the stable, and the half-reasoning parent of
combs, to display the brisk locomotion of Columbine, or the tortuous
attitudinizing of Punch;&mdash;these are the occupations of others, whose
ambition, limited to the applause of unintellectual fatuity, is too
innocuous for the application of satire, and too humble for the
incitement of jealousy.</p>

<p>Our refectory will be found to contain every species of fruit, from the
cooling nectarine and luscious peach to the puny pippin and the noxious
nut. There Indolence may repose, and Inebriety revel; and the spruce
apprentice, rushing in at second account, may there chatter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span> with
impunity; debarred, by a barrier of brick and mortar, from marring that
scenic interest in others, which nature and education have disqualified
him from comprehending himself.</p>

<p>Permanent stage-doors we have none. That which is permanent cannot
be removed, for, if removed, it soon ceases to be permanent. What
stationary absurdity can vie with that ligneous barricado, which,
decorated with frappant and tintinnabulant appendages, now serves
as the entrance of the lowly cottage, and now as the exit of a
lady's bed-chamber; at one time, insinuating plastic Harlequin into
a butcher's shop, and, at another, yawning, as a flood-gate, to
precipitate the Cyprians of St. Giles's into the embraces of Macheath.
To elude this glaring absurdity, to give to each respective mansion
the door which the carpenter would doubtless have given, we vary our
portal with the varying scene, passing from deal to mahogany, and from
mahogany to oak, as the opposite claims of cottage, palace, or castle,
may appear to require.</p>

<p>Amid the general hum of gratulation which flatters us in front, it
is fit that some regard should be paid to the murmurs of despondence
that assail us in the rear. They, as I have elsewhere expressed it,
'who live to please,' should not have their own pleasures entirely
overlooked. The children of Thespis are general in their censures
of the architect, in having placed the locality of exit at such a
distance from the oily irradiators which now dazzle the eyes of him
who addresses you. I am, cries the Queen of Terrors, robbed of my
fair proportions. When the king-killing Thane hints to the breathless
auditory the murders he means to perpetrate, in the castle of Macduff,
'ere his purpose cool,' so vast is the interval he has to travel
before he can escape from the stage, that his purpose has even time
to freeze. Your condition, cries the Muse of Smiles, is hard, but it
is cygnet's down in comparison with mine. The peerless peer of capers
and congees<a name="FNanchor_38_38" id="FNanchor_38_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a> has laid it down as a rule, that the best good thing
uttered by the morning visitor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span> should conduct him rapidly to the
doorway, last impressions vying in durability with first. But when, on
this boarded elongation, it falls to my lot to say a good thing, to
ejaculate, 'keep moving,' or to chant, '<i>hic hoc horum genitivo</i>,' many
are the moments that must elapse, ere I can hide myself from public
vision in the recesses of O. P. or P. S.</p>

<p>To objections like these, captiously urged and querulously maintained,
it is time that equity should conclusively reply. Deviation from
scenic propriety has only to vituperate itself for the consequences
it generates. Let the actor consider the line of exit as that line
beyond which he should not soar in quest of spurious applause: let him
reflect, that in proportion as he advances to the lamps, he recedes
from nature; that the truncheon of Hotspur acquires no additional
charm from encountering the cheek of beauty in the stage-box, and that
the bravura of Mandane may produce effect, although the throat of her
who warbles it should not overhang the orchestra. The Jove of the
modern critical Olympus, Lord Mayor of the theatric sky,<a name="FNanchor_39_39" id="FNanchor_39_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a> has, <i>ex
cathedrâ</i>, asserted, that a natural actor looks upon the audience part
of the theatre as the third side of the chamber he inhabits. Surely, of
the third wall thus fancifully erected, our actors should, by ridicule
or reason, be withheld from knocking their heads against the stucco.</p>


<p>Time forcibly reminds me, that all things which have a limit must be
brought to a conclusion. Let me, ere that conclusion arrives, recall
to your recollection, that the pillars which rise on either side of
me, blooming in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span> virid antiquity, like two massy evergreens, had yet
slumbered in their native quarry, but for the ardent exertions of
the individual who called them into life: to his never-slumbering
talents you are indebted for whatever pleasure this haunt of the muses
is calculated to afford. If, in defiance of chaotic malevolence,
the destroyer of the temple of Diana yet survives in the name of
Erostratus, surely we may confidently predict, that the rebuilder of
the temple of Apollo will stand recorded to distant posterity in that

        <div>Long wept my eye to see the timber planks</div>

        <div>I heard a trowel tick against a brick.</div>
        <div>I look'd me up, and straight a parapet</div>
        <div>Uprose at least seven inches o'er the planks.</div>

        <div>From the wall's pinnacle, they placed a pulley</div>
        <div>Athwart the pole, a rope athwart the pulley;</div>
        <div>To this a basket dangled; mortar and bricks</div>

<h3>THEATRICAL ALARM-BELL.</h3>

<h4>BY THE EDITOR OF THE M. P.<a name="FNanchor_52_52" id="FNanchor_52_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_52_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a></h4>

<p class="center p-left sm">Bounce, Jupiter, bounce!&mdash;<span class="smcap">O'Hara.</span></p>

<p class="smcap">Ladies and Gentlemen,</p>

<p class="left1">As it is now the universally-admitted, and indeed
pretty-generally-suspected, aim of Mr. Whitbread and the infamous,
bloodthirsty, and, in fact, illiberal faction to which he belongs,
to burn to the ground this free and happy Protestant city, and
establish himself in St. James's Palace, his fellow committee-men
have thought it their duty to watch the principles of a theatre built
under his auspices. The information they have received from undoubted
authority&mdash;particularly from an old fruit-woman who has turned king's
evidence, and whose name, for obvious reasons, we forbear to mention,
though we have had it some weeks in our possession&mdash;has induced them
to introduce various reforms&mdash;not such reforms as the vile faction
clamour for, meaning thereby revolution, but such reforms as are
necessary to preserve the glorious constitution of the only free,
happy, and prosperous country now left upon the face of the earth.
From the valuable and authentic source above alluded to, we have
learnt that a sanguinary plot has been formed by some united Irishmen,
combined with a gang of Luddites, and a special committee sent over
by the Pope at the instigation of the beastly Corsican fiend, for
destroying all the loyal part of the audience on the anniversary of
that deeply-to-be-abhorred and highly-to-be-blamed stratagem, the Gun<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
powder Plot, which falls this year on Thursday the 5th of November.
The whole is under the direction of a delegated committee of O.
P.'s, whose treasonable exploits at Covent Garden you all recollect,
and all of whom would have been hung from the chandeliers at that
time, but for the mistaken lenity of government. At a given signal,
a well-known O. P. was to cry out from the gallery, 'Nosey! Music!'
whereupon all the O. P.'s were to produce from their inside-pockets
a long pair of shears, edged with felt, to prevent their making any
noise, manufactured expressly by a wretch at Birmingham, one of Mr.
Brougham's evidences, and now in custody. With these they were to
cut off the heads of all the loyal N. P.'s in the house, without
distinction of sex or age. At the signal, similarly given, of 'Throw
him over!' which it now appears always alluded to the overthrow of our
never-sufficiently-enough-to-be-deeply-and-universally-to-be-venerated
constitution, all the heads of the N. P.'s were to be thrown at the
fiddlers, to prevent their appearing in evidence, or perhaps as a false
and illiberal insinuation that they have no heads of their own. All
that we know of the further designs of these incendiaries is, that they
are by-a-great-deal-too-much too-horrible-to-be-mentioned.</p>

<p>The Manager has acted with his usual promptitude on this trying
occasion. He has contracted for 300 tons of gunpowder, which are
at this moment placed in a small barrel under the pit; and a
descendant of Guy Faux, assisted by Col. Congreve, has undertaken
to blow up the house, when necessary, in so novel and ingenious
a manner, that every O. P. shall be annihilated, while not a
whisker of the N. P.'s shall be singed. This strikingly displays
the advantages of loyalty and attachment to government. Several
other hints have been taken from the theatrical regulations of the
not-a-bit-the-less-on-that-account-to-be-universally-execrated monster
Bonaparte. A park of artillery, provided with chain-shot, is to be
stationed on the stage, and play upon the audience, in case of any
indication of misplaced applause or popular discontent (which
accounts for the large space between the curtain and the lamps); and
the public will participate our satisfaction in learn<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>ing that the
indecorous custom of standing up with the hat on is to be abolished, as
the Bow-street officers are provided with daggers, and have orders to
stab all such persons to the heart, and send their bodies to Surgeons'
Hall. Gentlemen who cough are only to be slightly wounded. Fruit-women
bawling 'Bill of the play!' are to be forthwith shot, for which purpose
soldiers will be stationed in the slips, and ball-cartridge is to be
served out with the lemonade. If any of the spectators happen to sneeze
or spit, they are to be transported for life; and any person who is
so tall as to prevent another seeing, is to be dragged out and sent
on board the tender, or, by an instrument taken out of the pocket of
Procrustes, to be forthwith cut shorter, either at the head or foot,
according as his own convenience may dictate.</p>

<p>Thus, ladies and gentlemen, have the committee, through my medium,
set forth the not-in-a-hurry-to-be-paralleled plan they have
adopted for preserving order and decorum within the walls of their
magnificent edifice. Nor have they, while attentive to their own
concerns, by any means overlooked those of the cities of London
and Westminster. Finding, on enumeration, that they have with a
with-two-hands-and-one-tongue-to-be-applauded liberality, contracted
for more gunpowder than they want, they have parted with the surplus
to the mattock-carrying and hustings-hammering high bailiff of
Westminster, who has, with his own shovel, dug a large hole in
the front of the parish church of St. Paul, Covent Garden, that,
upon the least symptom of ill-breeding in the mob at the general
election, the whole of the market may be blown into the air. This,
ladies and gentlemen, may at first make provisions <i>rise</i>, but
we pledge the credit of our theatre that they will soon <i>fall</i>
again, and people be supplied, as usual, with vegetables, in the
in-general-strewed-with-cabbage-stalks-but-on-Saturday-night-lighted-up-with-lamps
market of Covent Garden.</p>

<p>I should expatiate more largely on the other advantages of the glorious
constitution of these by-the-whole-of-Europe-envied realms, but I am
called away to take an account of the ladies, and other artificial<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
flowers, at a fashionable rout, of which a full and particular account
will hereafter appear. For the present, my fashionable intelligence is
scanty, on account of the opening of Drury Lane; and the ladies and
gentlemen who honour me with their attention will not be surprised if
they find nothing under my usual head!!</p>

<p>If the following poem should be fortunate enough to be selected for the
opening address, a few words of explanation may be deemed necessary, on
my part, to avert invidious misrepresentation. The animadversion I have
thought it right to make on the noise created by tuning the orchestra,
will, I hope, give no lasting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span> remorse to any of the gentlemen employed
in the band. It is to be desired that they would keep their instruments
ready tuned, and strike off at once. This would be an accommodation
to many well-meaning persons who frequent the theatre, who, not being
blest with the ear of St. Cecilia, mistake the tuning for the overture,
and think the latter concluded before it is begun.</p>

        <div>Give, half-ashamed, a tiny flourish still,'</div>

    </div>
  </div>

<p class="p-left">was originally written 'one hautboy will'; but, having
providentially been informed, when this poem was upon the point of
being sent off, that there is but one hautboy in the band, I averted
the storm of popular and managerial indignation from the head of
its blower: as it now stands, 'one fiddle' among many, the faulty
individual will, I hope, escape detection. The story of the flying
play-bill is calculated to expose a practice much too common, of
pinning play-bills to the cushions insecurely, and frequently, I fear,
not pinning them at all. If these lines save one play-bill only from
the fate I have recorded, I shall not deem my labour ill employed.
The concluding episode of Patrick Jennings glances at the boorish
fashion of wearing the hat in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span> one-shilling gallery. Had Jennings
thrust his between his feet at the commencement of the play, he might
have leaned forward with impunity, and the catastrophe I relate would
not have occurred. The line of handkerchiefs formed to enable him to
recover his loss, is purposely so crossed in texture and materials as
to mislead the reader in respect to the real owner of any one of them.
For, in the satirical view of life and manners which I occasionally
present, my clerical profession has taught me how extremely improper
it would be, by any allusion, however slight, to give any uneasiness,
however trivial, to any individual, however foolish or wicked.</p>

<p>'"The Theatre," by the Rev. G. Crabbe, we rather think, is
the best piece in the collection. It is an exquisite and
most masterly imitation, not only of the peculiar style,
but of the taste, temper, and manner of description of that
most original author; and can hardly be said to be in any
respect a caricature of that style or manner&mdash;except in
the excessive profusion of puns and verbal jingles&mdash;which,
though undoubtedly to be ranked among his characteristics,
are never so thick-sown in his original works as in this
admirable imitation. It does not aim, of course, at any
shadow of his pathos or moral sublimity, but seems to us

<p class="smcap">Gentlemen,</p>

<p class="left1">Happening to be wool-gathering at the foot of Mount Parnassus, I
was suddenly seized with a violent travestie in the head. The first
symptoms I felt were several triple rhymes floating about my brain,
accom<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>panied by a singing in my throat, which quickly communicated
itself to the ears of everybody about me, and made me a burthen to
my friends and a torment to Doctor Apollo; three of whose favourite
servants&mdash;that is to say, Macbeth, his butcher; Mrs. Haller, his cook;
and George Barnwell, his book-keeper&mdash;I waylaid in one of my fits of
insanity, and mauled after a very frightful fashion. In this woful
crisis, I accidentally heard of your invaluable New Patent Hissing Pit,
which cures every disorder incident to Grub Street. I send you enclosed
a more detailed specimen of my ease: if you could mould it into the
shape of an address, to be said or sung on the first night of your
performance, I have no doubt that I should feel the immediate effects
of your invaluable New Patent Hissing Pit, of which they tell me one
hiss is a dose.</p>

<p>'"Punch's Apotheosis," by G. Colman, junior, is too purely

<p>'We have no conjectures to offer as to the anonymous author
of this amusing little volume. He who is such a master of
disguises may easily be supposed to have been successful in
concealing himself, and, with the power of assuming so many
styles, is not likely to be detected by his own. We should
guess, however, that he had not written a great deal in his
own character&mdash;that his natural style was neither very lofty
nor very grave&mdash;and that he rather indulges a partiality
for puns and verbal pleasantries. We marvel why he has shut
out Campbell and Rogers from his theatre of living poets,
and confidently expect to have our curiosity in this and
in all other particulars very speedily gratified, when the
applause of the country shall induce him to take off his
mask.'&mdash;<i>Edinburgh Review.</i></p>

<p><i>Additional note intended for p. 61.</i>&mdash;This journal was, at
the period in question, rather remarkable for the use of the
figure called by the rhetoricians <i>catachresis</i>. The Bard of
Avon may be quoted in justification of its adoption, when he
writes of taking arms against a sea, and seeking a bubble in
the mouth of a cannon. <i>The Morning Post</i>, in the year 1812,
congratulated its readers upon having stripped off Cobbett's
mask and discovered his cloven foot; adding, that it was high
time to give the hydra-head of Faction a rap on the knuckles!</p></blockquote>

        <div>The natural circulation of the blood</div>
        <div>Thereby was oft impeded, and he felt</div>
        <div>So numb'd at times, that when he strove to rise</div>
        <div>Up from his work he could not, but fell back</div>
        <div>Among the shreds and patches that bestrew'd</div>
        <div>With various colours, brightening gorgeously,</div>

        <div>Over three horses (each of larger size</div>
        <div>Than our small mountain-breed) one of the troop</div>
        <div>Put out his shoulder, and was otherwise</div>
        <div>Considerably bruised, especially</div>
        <div>About the loins and back. So he became</div>
        <div>Useless unto that wandering company,</div>
        <div>And likely to be felt a sore expense</div>
        <div>To men just on the eve of bankruptcy,</div>
        <div>So the master of the troop determined</div>
        <div>To leave him in the workhouse, and proclaim'd</div>
        <div>That if there was a man among the crowd</div>
        <div>Willing to fill his place and able too,</div>
        <div>Now was the time to show himself. Hugh Thwaites</div>
        <div>Heard the proposal, as he stood apart</div>
        <div>Striving with his own soul&mdash;and with a bound</div>
        <div>He leapt into the circle, and agreed</div>
        <div>To supply the place of him who had been hurt.</div>
        <div>A shout of admiration and surprise</div>
        <div>Then tore heaven's concave, and completely fill'd</div>

        <div>Of various occupations and professions,</div>
        <div>To explain the cause of one phenomenon,</div>

        <div>A bare enunciation, unexplain'd</div>
        <div>By any theory, or mental light</div>

        <div>I now allude to that most curious fact,</div>
        <div>That 'mid a given number, say threescore,</div>

        <div>The nature of excessive action&mdash;so</div>
        <div>That in all human beings who keep moving,</div>

        <div>That, active in their inactivity,</div>
        <div>And unreposing in their long repose,</div>
        <div>They are, in fact, the sole depositaries</div>
        <div>Of all the energies by others wasted,</div>

        <div>Their bodies too, for arms and legs can't move</div>
        <div>Without the body&mdash;as the waving branch</div>

        <div>Stray patch of fustian, cloth, or cassimere,</div>
        <div>Which, as by natural instinct, he discerns,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span></div>

        <div>Of this despised profession. Deem not thou,</div>
        <div>O rashly deem not, that his boyish days</div>
        <div>Past at the shop-board, when the stripling bore</div>
        <div>With bashful feeling of apprenticeship</div>
        <div>The name of Tailor, deem not that his soul</div>
        <div>Derived no genial influence from a life,</div>
        <div>Which, although haply adverse in the main</div>
        <div>To the growth of intellect, and the excursive power,</div>
        <div>Yet in its ordinary forms possessed</div>
        <div>A constant influence o'er his passing thoughts,</div>
        <div>Moulded his appetences and his will,</div>
        <div>And wrought out, by the work of sympathy,</div>
        <div>Between his bodily and mental form,</div>
        <div>Rare correspondence, wond'rous unity!</div>
        <div>Perfect&mdash;complete&mdash;and fading not away.</div>
        <div>While on his board cross-legg'd he used to sit,</div>
        <div>Shaping of various garments, to his mind</div>
        <div>An image rose of every character</div>
        <div>For whom each special article was framed,</div>
        <div>Coat, waistcoat, breeches. So at last his soul</div>
        <div>Was like a storehouse, filled with images,</div>
        <div>By musing hours of solitude supplied.</div>
        <div>Nor did his ready fingers shape the cut</div>
        <div>Of villager's uncouth habiliments</div>
        <div>With greater readiness, than did his mind</div>
        <div>Frame corresponding images of those</div>
        <div>Whose corporal measurement the neat-mark'd paper</div>
        <div>In many a mystic notch for ay retain'd.</div>
        <div>Hence, more than any man I ever knew,</div>
        <div>Did he possess the power intuitive</div>
        <div>Of diving into character. A pair</div>
        <div>Of breeches to his philosophic eye</div>
        <div>Were not what unto other folks they seem,</div>
        <div>Mere simple breeches, but in them he saw</div>

        <div>Vainly imagined tomb of monarchs old,</div>
        <div>But raised by wise philosophy, that sought</div>
        <div>By darkness to illumine, and to spread</div>
        <div>Knowledge by dim concealment&mdash;process high</div>
        <div>Of man's imaginative, deathless soul.</div>
        <div>Nor, haply, in th' abasement of the life</div>
        <div>Which stern necessity had made his own,</div>
        <div>Did he not recognise a genial power</div>
        <div>Of soul-ennobling fortitude. He heard</div>
        <div>Unmoved the witling's shallow contumely,</div>
        <div>And thus, in spite of nature, by degrees</div>
        <div>He saw a beauty and a majesty</div>
        <div>In this despised trade, which warrior's brow</div>
        <div>Hath rarely circled&mdash;so that when he sat</div>
        <div>Beneath his sky-light window, he hath cast</div>
        <div>A gaze of triumph on the godlike sun,</div>

        <div>Of flowers in the heavenly paradise;</div>
        <div>Its track a beam of the sun refined,</div>

        <div>Little feet with sandals tied,</div>
        <div>Shallow heads and shoulders wide;</div>

        <div>Dancing on the chalky floor:</div>
        <div>And wise mamma, well pleased to see</div>
        <div>Her daughter paired with high degree,</div>
        <div>Stays till the daylight glares amain:</div>
        <div>Then in the carriage home again,</div>
        <div>With stories told, of many a bow,</div>
        <div>And civil speech from so and so.</div>
        <div>She was ask'd to dance, she said,</div>

        <div>He whisper'd many a pretty word,</div>
        <div>Such as no poet could excel!</div>
        <div>Then, having paid his court so well,</div>

        <div>And watch'd till she was seen no more.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span></div>

        <div>And tenants come, whose county franchise</div>
        <div>Connects them with the higher branches,</div>
        <div>Since all the great alike contend</div>
        <div>For votes, on which they all depend.</div>
        <div>Let Affability be there,</div>
        <div>With cordial hand and friendly air,</div>
        <div>And private play and glittering fête,</div>
        <div>To make the rustic gentry prate,&mdash;</div>
        <div>Such joys as fill young ladies' heads,</div>
        <div>Who judge from books of masquerades.</div>
        <div>Then will I to St. Stephen's stray,</div>
        <div>If aught be moved by Castlereagh,</div>
        <div>Or matchless Canning mean to roll</div>
        <div>His thunders o'er the subject soul.</div>
        <div>And sometimes, to divert my cares,</div>
        <div>Give me some flirt, with joyous airs,</div>
        <div>Married a girl, a widow now,</div>
        <div>Such as will hear each playful vow,</div>
        <div>Too young to lay upon the shelf:</div>
        <div>Meaning&mdash;as little as myself:&mdash;</div>
        <div>Still speaking, singing, walking, running,</div>
        <div>With wanton heed and giddy cunning.</div>
        <div>With a good mien to testify</div>
        <div>Her converse with good company,</div>
        <div>That Chesterfield might lift his eyes</div>
        <div>From the dark Tartarus where he lies,</div>
        <div>Beholding, in her air and gait,</div>
        <div>Graces that almost compensate</div>
        <div>The blunders of his awkward son,</div>
        <div>And half the harm his book has done.</div>
        <div>These delights if thou canst give,</div>
        <div>Fashion, with thee I wish to live.</div>

        <div>First, the antenatal Peter,</div>
        <div>Wrapped in weeds of the same metre,</div>
        <div>The so-long-predestined raiment</div>
        <div>Clothed in which to walk his way meant</div>
        <div>The second Peter; whose ambition</div>
        <div>Is to link the proposition,</div>
        <div>As the mean of two extremes&mdash;</div>

        <div>Like the shadow in the glass</div>
        <div>Of the second, yet unripe,</div>
        <div>His substantial antitype.&mdash;</div>
        <div>Then came Peter Bell the Second,</div>
        <div>Who henceforward must be reckoned</div>
        <div>The body of a double soul,</div>

        <div>Ends of a disjointed dream.&mdash;</div>

        <div>Like the soul before it is</div>
        <div>Born from <i>that</i> world into <i>this</i>.</div>
        <div>The next Peter Bell was he,</div>
        <div>Predevote, like you and me,</div>
        <div>To good or evil as may come;</div>
        <div>His was the severer doom,&mdash;</div>

        <div class="i1">In pensive glooms and corners, scarcely spied;</div>
        <div class="i1">Not, as in Founders' Halls and domes of pride,</div>
        <div class="i1">Served with grave homage, like a tragic queen,</div>
        <div class="i1">But with one lonely priest compell'd to hide,</div>
        <div class="i1">In midst of foggy moors and mosses green,</div>
        <div>In that clay cabin hight the College of Kilreen!</div>

      <div class="stanza">
        <div class="i1">This College looketh South and West alsoe,</div>

        <div class="i1">Crazy and crack'd they be, and wind doth blow</div>
        <div class="i1">Thorough transparent holes in every pane,</div>
        <div class="i1">Which Dan, with many paines, makes whole again</div>
        <div class="i1">With nether garments, which his thrift doth teach</div>
        <div class="i1">To stand for glass, like pronouns, and when rain</div>
        <div class="i1">Stormeth, he puts, 'once more unto the breach,'</div>
        <div>Outside and in, tho' broke, yet so he mendeth each.</div>

        <div class="i1">Thus written,</div>
        <div class="i5 sm">'CHILDREN TAKEN IN TO BATE.'</div>
        <div class="i1">And oft, indeed, the inward of that gate,</div>
        <div class="i1">Most ventriloque, doth utter tender squeak,</div>
        <div class="i1">And moans of infants that bemoan their fate,</div>
        <div class="i1">In midst of sounds of Latin, French, and Greek,</div>
        <div>Which, all i' the Irish tongue, he teacheth them to speak.</div>

        <div class="i1">While, sometimes, Partlet, from her gloomy perch,</div>
        <div class="i1">Drops feather on the nose of Dominie,</div>
        <div class="i1">Meanwhile, with serious eye, he makes research</div>
        <div>In leaves of that sour tree of knowledge&mdash;now a birch.</div>

        <div class="i1">Large, as a dome for learning, seems his head,</div>
        <div class="i1">And like Apollo's, all beset with rays,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span></div>
        <div class="i1">Because his locks are so unkempt and red,</div>

        <div>No laurel crown he wears, howbeit his cap is baize.</div>

        <div class="i1">A mongrel tint, that is ne brown ne blue;</div>
        <div class="i1">His nose,&mdash;it is a coral to the view;</div>
        <div class="i1">Well nourished with Pierian Potheen,&mdash;</div>
        <div class="i1">For much he loves his native mountain dew;&mdash;</div>
        <div class="i1">But to depict the dye would lack, I ween,</div>
        <div>A bottle-red, in terms, as well as bottle-green.</div>

      <div class="stanza">
        <div class="i1">As for his coat, 'tis such a jerkin short</div>

        <div class="i1">But underneath he hath no vest, nor aught,</div>
        <div class="i1">So that the wind his airy breast assails;</div>
        <div class="i1">Below, he wears the nether garb of males,</div>
        <div class="i1">Of crimson plush, but non-plushed at the knee;&mdash;</div>
        <div class="i1">Thence further down the native red prevails,</div>
        <div class="i1">Of his own naked fleecy hosiery:&mdash;</div>
        <div>Two sandals, without soles, complete his cap-a-pee.</div>

<h4>X.</h4>

      <div class="stanza">
        <div class="i1">Nathless, for dignity, he now doth lap</div>
        <div class="i1">His function in a magisterial gown,</div>
        <div class="i1">That shows more countries in it than a map,&mdash;</div>
        <div class="i1">Blue tinct, and red, and green, and russet brown,</div>
        <div class="i1">Besides some blots, standing for country-town;</div>
        <div class="i1">And eke some rents, for streams and rivers wide;</div>
        <div class="i1">But, sometimes, bashful when he looks adown,</div>
        <div class="i1">He turns the garment of the other side,</div>
        <div>Hopeful that so the holes may never be espied!</div>
      </div>

      <div class="stanza">
        <div class="i1">And soe he sits, amidst the little pack,</div>

        <div class="i1">Within his visage, like an almanack,&mdash;</div>
        <div class="i1">His quiet smile foretelling gracious boon:</div>
        <div class="i1">But when his mouth droops down, like rainy moon,</div>
        <div class="i1">With horrid chill each little heart unwarms,</div>
        <div class="i1">Knowing that infant show'rs will follow soon,</div>
        <div class="i1">And with forebodings of near wrath and storms</div>
        <div>They sit, like timid hares, all trembling on their forms.</div>

        <div>For many a month, unseen, among the Dons.</div>
        <div>Nor in the lodge, nor in the library,</div>
        <div>Upon its pedestal appeared, to be</div>
        <div>A mark for reverence of green gownsman-hood,</div>
        <div>Of grief to ancient fogies, and reproof</div>
        <div>To those who knew not Alfred, being hard</div>
        <div>And narrowed in their honour to old names</div>
        <div>Of poets, who had vogue when <i>they</i> were young,</div>
        <div>And not admitting later bards; but now,</div>
        <div>Last week, a rumour widely blown about,</div>
        <div>Walking the windy circle of the Press,</div>
        <div>Came, that stern Whewell, with the Seniors,</div>
        <div>Who rule the destinies of Trinity,</div>
        <div>Had of the sanctuary barred access</div>
        <div>Unto the bust of Alfred Tennyson,</div>
        <div>By Woolner carved, subscribed for by the youth</div>
        <div>Who loved the Poet, hoped to see him set</div>
        <div>Within the Library of Trinity,</div>
        <div>One great man more o' the house, among the great,</div>
        <div>Who grace that still Valhalla, ranged in row,</div>
        <div>Along the chequered marbles of the floor,</div>
        <div>Two stately ranks&mdash;to where the fragrant limes</div>
        <div>Look thro' the far end window, cool and green.</div>
        <div>A band it is, of high companionship,&mdash;</div>
        <div>Chief, Newton, and the broad-browed Verulam,</div>
        <div>And others only less than these in arts</div>
        <div>Or science: names that England holds on high.</div>
        <div>Among whom, hoped the youth, would soon be set,</div>
        <div>The living likeness of a living Bard,&mdash;</div>
        <div>Great Alfred Tennyson, the Laureate,</div>
        <div>Whom Trinity most loves of living sons.</div>

        <div>Deeming such honour only due to those</div>
        <div>Upon whose greatness Death had set his seal.</div>
        <div>So fixed their faces hard, and shut the doors</div>
        <div>Upon the living Poet: for, said one,</div>
        <div>'It is too soon,' and when they heard the phrase,</div>
        <div>Others caught up the cue, and chorussed it,</div>
        <div>Until, the Poet echoing 'Soon? too soon?'</div>
        <div>As if in wrath, Whewell looked up, and said:&mdash;</div>
        <div>'O Laureate, if indeed you list to try,</div>
        <div>Try, and unfix our purpose in this thing.'</div>
        <div>Whereat full shrilly sang th' excluded bard:</div>
      </div>

      <div class="stanza">
        <div class="i1">'Soon, soon, so soon! Whewell looks stern and chill,</div>
        <div class="i1">Soon, soon, so soon! but I can enter still.'</div>
        <div class="i2">'Too soon, too soon! You cannot enter now.'</div>

     </div>

      <div class="stanza">
        <div class="i1">'Honour in life is sweet: my fame is wide,</div>
        <div class="i1">Let me to stand at Dryden's, Byron's side.'</div>
        <div class="i2">'Too soon, too soon! You cannot enter now!'</div>

        <div>And odours haunt me of remotest spice</div>

        <div class="i1">In youth, when pickles were a passing pain;</div>
        <div>Unwitting youth, that craves the candy stem,</div>

        <div>Respectable, much in demand, well fed</div>
        <div>With mine own larder's dainties,&mdash;where, indeed,</div>
        <div>Such cakes of myrrh or fine alyssum seed,</div>
        <div>Thin as a mallow-leaf, embrowned o' the top,</div>
        <div>Which, cracking, lets the ropy, trickling drop</div>
        <div>Of sweetness touch your tongue, or potted nests</div>
        <div>Which my recondite recipe invests</div>
        <div>With cold conglomerate tidbits&mdash;ah, the bill!</div>

        <div>My chests, the case so put were yours, we'll say,</div>
        <div>(This counter, here, your post, as mine to-day,)</div>
        <div>And you've an eye to luxuries, what harm</div>
        <div>In smoothing down your palate with the charm</div>
        <div>Yourself concocted? There we issue take;</div>
        <div>And see! as thus across the rim I break</div>
        <div>This puffy paunch of glazed embroidered cake,</div>
        <div>So breaks, through use, the lust of watering chaps</div>
        <div>And craveth plainness: do I so? Perhaps;</div>
        <div>But that's my secret. Find me such a man</div>
        <div>As Lippo yonder, built upon the plan</div>
        <div>Of heavy storage, double-navelled, fat</div>
        <div>From his own giblets' oil, an Ararat</div>
        <div>Uplift o'er water, sucking rosy draughts</div>
        <div>From Noah's vineyard,&mdash;... crisp, enticing wafts</div>
        <div>Yon kitchen now emits, which to your sense</div>
        <div>Somewhat abate the fear of old events,</div>
        <div>Qualms to the stomach,&mdash;I, you see, am slow</div>
        <div>Unnecessary duties to forgo,&mdash;</div>
        <div>You understand? A venison haunch, <i>haut goût</i>,</div>
        <div>Ducks that in Cimbrian olives mildly stew,</div>
        <div>And sprigs of anise, might one's teeth provoke</div>
        <div>To taste, and so we wear the complex yoke</div>
        <div>Just as it suits,&mdash;my liking, I confess,</div>
        <div>More to receive, and to partake no less,</div>
        <div>Still more obese, while through thick adipose</div>
        <div>Sensation shoots, from testing tongue to toes</div>
        <div>Far-off, dim-conscious, at the body's verge,</div>
        <div>Where the froth-whispers of its waves emerge</div>
        <div>On the untasting sand. Stay, now! a seat</div>
        <div>Is bare: I, Angelo, will sit and eat.</div>

        <div>And danced unchaperoned, and laughed unchecked,</div>

<h3>HIAWATHA'S PHOTOGRAPHING.</h3>

<h4>(LONGFELLOW)</h4>

<blockquote class="sm">

<p>In an age of imitation, I can claim no sort of merit for this
slight attempt at doing what is known to be so easy. Anyone
who knows what verse is, with the slightest ear for rhythm,
can throw off a composition in the easy running metre of 'The
Song of Hiawatha.' Having, then, distinctly stated that I
challenge no attention, in the following little poem, to its
merely verbal jingle, I must beg the candid reader, to confine
his criticism to its treatment of the subject.</p></blockquote>

  <div class="poetry-container">
    <div class="poetry">
      <div class="stanza">
        <div class="i1">From his shoulder Hiawatha</div>
        <div>Took the camera of rosewood,</div>
        <div>Made of sliding, folding rosewood;</div>
        <div>Neatly put it all together.</div>
        <div>In its case it lay compactly,</div>
        <div>Folded into nearly nothing;</div>
        <div>But he opened out the hinges,</div>
        <div>Pushed and pulled the joints and hinges,</div>
        <div>Till it looked all squares and oblongs,</div>
        <div>Like a complicated figure</div>
        <div>In the second book of Euclid.</div>
        <div class="i1">This he perched upon a tripod,</div>
        <div>And the family in order</div>
        <div>Sat before him for their pictures.</div>
        <div>Mystic, awful was the process.</div>
        <div class="i1">First a piece of glass he coated</div>
        <div>With Collodion, and plunged it</div>
        <div>In a bath of Lunar Caustic</div>
        <div>Carefully dissolved in water:</div>
        <div>There he left it certain minutes.</div>
        <div class="i1">Secondly, my Hiawatha</div>
        <div>Made with cunning hand a mixture</div>
        <div>Of the acid Pyro-gallic,</div>
        <div>And of Glacial Acetic,</div>
        <div>And of Alcohol and water:</div>
        <div>This developed all the picture.</div>
        <div class="i1">Finally, he fixed each picture</div>
        <div>With a saturate solution</div>
        <div>Of a certain salt of Soda&mdash;</div>
        <div>Chemists call it Hyposulphite.</div>
        <div>(Very difficult the name is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[311]</a></span></div>
        <div>For a metre like the present,</div>
        <div>But periphrasis has done it.)</div>
        <div class="i1">All the family in order</div>
        <div>Sat before him for their pictures.</div>
        <div>Each in turn, as he was taken,</div>
        <div>Volunteered his own suggestions,</div>
        <div>His invaluable suggestions.</div>
        <div class="i1">First the Governor, the Father:</div>
        <div>He suggested velvet curtains</div>
        <div>Looped about a massy pillar;</div>
        <div>And the corner of a table,</div>
        <div>Of a rosewood dining-table.</div>
        <div>He would hold a scroll of something,</div>
        <div>Hold it firmly in his left-hand;</div>
        <div>He would keep his right-hand buried</div>
        <div>(Like Napoleon) in his waistcoat;</div>
        <div>He would contemplate the distance</div>
        <div>With a look of pensive meaning,</div>
        <div>As of ducks that die in tempests.</div>
        <div class="i1">Grand, heroic was the notion:</div>
        <div>Yet the picture failed entirely:</div>
        <div>Failed, because he moved a little,</div>
        <div>Moved, because he couldn't help it.</div>
        <div class="i1">Next, his better half took courage;</div>
        <div><i>She</i> would have her picture taken:</div>
        <div>She came dressed beyond description,</div>
        <div>Dressed in jewels and in satin</div>
        <div>Far too gorgeous for an empress.</div>
        <div>Gracefully she sat down sideways,</div>
        <div>With a simper scarcely human,</div>
        <div>Holding in her hand a nosegay</div>
        <div>Rather larger than a cabbage.</div>
        <div>All the while that she was taking,</div>
        <div>Still the lady chattered, chattered,</div>
        <div>Like a monkey in the forest.</div>
        <div>'Am I sitting still?' she asked him.</div>
        <div>'Is my face enough in profile?</div>
        <div>Shall I hold the nosegay higher?</div>
        <div>Will it come into the picture?'</div>
        <div>And the picture failed completely.</div>
        <div class="i1">Next the Son, the Stunning-Cantab:</div>
        <div>He suggested curves of beauty,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[312]</a></span></div>
        <div>Curves pervading all his figure,</div>
        <div>Which the eye might follow onward,</div>
        <div>Till they centred in the breast-pin,</div>
        <div>Centred in the golden breast-pin.</div>
        <div>He had learnt it all from Ruskin</div>
        <div>(Author of 'The Stones of Venice,'</div>
        <div>'Seven Lamps of Architecture,'</div>
        <div>'Modern Painters,' and some others);</div>
        <div>And perhaps he had not fully</div>
        <div>Understood his author's meaning;</div>
        <div>But, whatever was the reason,</div>
        <div>All was fruitless, as the picture</div>
        <div>Ended in an utter failure.</div>
        <div class="i1">Next to him the eldest daughter:</div>
        <div>She suggested very little;</div>
        <div>Only asked if he would take her</div>
        <div>With her look of 'passive beauty.'</div>
        <div class="i1">Her idea of passive beauty</div>
        <div>Was a squinting of the left-eye,</div>
        <div>Was a drooping of the right-eye,</div>
        <div>Was a smile that went up sideways</div>
        <div>To the comer of the nostrils.</div>
        <div class="i1">Hiawatha, when she asked him,</div>
        <div>Took no notice of the question,</div>
        <div>Looked as if he hadn't heard it;</div>
        <div>But, when pointedly appealed to,</div>
        <div>Smiled in his peculiar manner,</div>
        <div>Coughed and said it 'didn't matter,'</div>
        <div>Bit his lip and changed the subject.</div>
        <div class="i1">Nor in this was he mistaken,</div>
        <div>As the picture failed completely.</div>
        <div class="i1">So in turn the other sisters.</div>
        <div>Last, the youngest son was taken:</div>
        <div>Very rough and thick his hair was,</div>
        <div>Very round and red his face was,</div>
        <div>Very dusty was his jacket,</div>
        <div>Very fidgetty his manner.</div>
        <div>And his overbearing sisters</div>
        <div>Called him names he disapproved of:</div>
        <div>Called him Johnny, 'Daddy's Darling,'</div>
        <div>Called him Jacky, 'Scrubby School-boy,'</div>
        <div>And, so awful was the picture,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[313]</a></span></div>
        <div>In comparison the others</div>
        <div>Might be thought to have succeeded,</div>
        <div>To have partially succeeded.</div>
        <div class="i1">Finally my Hiawatha</div>
        <div>Tumbled all the tribe together,</div>
        <div>'Grouped' is not the right expression,)</div>
        <div>And, as happy chance would have it,</div>
        <div>Did at last obtain a picture</div>
        <div>Where the faces all succeeded:</div>
        <div>Each came out a perfect likeness.</div>
        <div class="i1">Then they joined and all abused it,</div>
        <div>Unrestrainedly abused it,</div>
        <div>As 'the worst and ugliest picture</div>
        <div>They could possibly have dreamed of.</div>
        <div>Giving one such strange expressions!</div>
        <div>Sulkiness, conceit, and meanness!</div>
        <div>Really any one would take us</div>
        <div>(Any one that did not know us)</div>
        <div>For the most unpleasant people!'</div>
        <div>(Hiawatha seemed to think so,</div>
        <div>Seemed to think it not unlikely.)</div>
        <div>All together rang their voices,</div>
        <div>Angry, loud, discordant voices,</div>
        <div>As of dogs that howl in concert,</div>
        <div>As of cats that wail in chorus.</div>
        <div class="i1">But my Hiawatha's patience,</div>
        <div>His politeness and his patience,</div>
        <div>Unaccountably had vanished,</div>
        <div>And he left that happy party.</div>
        <div>Neither did he leave them slowly,</div>
        <div>With that calm deliberation,</div>
        <div>That intense deliberation</div>
        <div>Which photographers aspire to:</div>
        <div>But he left them in a hurry,</div>
        <div>Left them in a mighty hurry,</div>
        <div>Vowing that he would not stand it.</div>
        <div class="i1">Hurriedly he packed his boxes,</div>
        <div>Hurriedly the porter trundled</div>
        <div>On a barrow all his boxes;</div>
        <div>Hurriedly he took his ticket,</div>
        <div>Hurriedly the train received him:</div>
        <div>Thus departed Hiawatha.</div>

      </div>

      <div class="stanza">
        <div>It passed athwart the glooming flat&mdash;</div>
        <div>It fanned his forehead as he sat&mdash;</div>
        <div>It lightly bore away his hat,</div>
      </div>

      <div class="stanza">
        <div>All to the feet of one who stood</div>
        <div>Like maid enchanted in a wood,</div>

      </div>

      <div class="stanza">
        <div>With huge umbrella, lank and brown,</div>
        <div>Unerringly she pinned it down,</div>

      </div>

      <div class="stanza">
        <div>Then, with an aspect cold and grim,</div>

        <div>She took it up and gave it him.</div>
      </div>

      <div class="stanza">
        <div>Awhile like one in dreams he stood,</div>
        <div>Then faltered forth his gratitude,</div>
        <div>In words just short of being rude:</div>
      </div>

      <div class="stanza">
        <div>For it had lost its shape and shine,</div>
        <div>And it had cost him four-and-nine,</div>

      </div>

      <div class="stanza">
        <div>With grave indifference to his speech,</div>

      </div>

      <div class="stanza">
        <div>He could not answer yea or nay:</div>
        <div>He faltered 'Gifts may pass away.'</div>
        <div>Yet knew not what he meant to say.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[315]</a></span></div>
      </div>

      <div class="stanza">
        <div>'If that be so,' she straight replied,</div>
        <div>'Each heart with each doth coincide.</div>
        <div>What boots it? For the world is wide.'</div>
      </div>

      <div class="stanza">

      </div>

      <div class="stanza">
        <div>But when she asked him 'Wherefore so?'</div>

      <div class="stanza">
        <div>While, like broad waves of golden grain.</div>

      </div>

      <div class="stanza">
        <div>Pitying his obvious distress,</div>
        <div>Yet with a tinge of bitterness,</div>
        <div>She said 'The More exceeds the Less.'</div>
      </div>

      <div class="stanza">
        <div>'A truth of such undoubted weight,</div>
        <div>He urged, 'and so extreme in date,</div>

      <div class="stanza">

<h3>MRS. JUDGE JENKINS.</h3>

<p class="center p-left sm">[Being the only genuine sequel to 'Maud Muller.']</p>

<h4>(WHITTIER)</h4>

  <div class="poetry-container">
    <div class="poetry">
      <div class="stanza">
        <div>Maud Muller all that summer day</div>
        <div>Raked the meadows sweet with hay;</div>
      </div>

      <div class="stanza">
        <div>Yet, looking down the distant lane,</div>
        <div>She hoped the judge would come again.</div>
      </div>

      <div class="stanza">
        <div>But when he came, with smile and bow,</div>
        <div>Maud only blushed, and stammered, 'Ha-ow?'</div>
      </div>

      <div class="stanza">
        <div>And spoke of her 'pa,' and wondered whether</div>
        <div>He'd give consent they should wed together.</div>
      </div>

      <div class="stanza">
        <div>Old Muller burst in tears, and then</div>
        <div>Begged that the judge would lend him 'ten';</div>
      </div>

      <div class="stanza">
        <div>For trade was dull, and wages low,</div>
        <div>And the 'craps' this year were somewhat slow.</div>
      </div>

      <div class="stanza">
        <div>And ere the languid summer died,</div>
        <div>Sweet Maud became the judge's bride.</div>
      </div>

      <div class="stanza">
        <div>But on the day that they were mated</div>
        <div>Maud's brother Bob was intoxicated;</div>
      </div>

      <div class="stanza">
        <div>And Maud's relations, twelve in all,</div>
        <div>Were very drunk at the judge's hall.</div>
      </div>

      <div class="stanza">
        <div>And when the summer came again,</div>
        <div>The young bride bore him babies twain.</div>
      </div>

      <div class="stanza">
        <div>And the judge was blest, but thought it strange</div>
        <div>That bearing children made such a change:</div>
      </div>

      <div class="stanza">
        <div>For Maud grew broad and red and stout:</div>
        <div>And the waist that his arm once clasped about</div>
      </div>

      <div class="stanza">
        <div>Was more than he now could span; and he</div>
        <div>Sighed as he pondered, ruefully,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">[344]</a></span></div>
      </div>

      <div class="stanza">
        <div>How that which in Maud was native grace</div>
        <div>In Mrs. Jenkins was out of place;</div>
      </div>

      <div class="stanza">
        <div>And thought of the twins, and wished that they</div>
        <div>Looked less like the man who raked the hay</div>
      </div>

      <div class="stanza">
        <div>On Muller's farm, and dreamed with pain</div>
        <div>Of the day he wandered down the lane,</div>
      </div>

      <div class="stanza">
        <div>And, looking down that dreary track,</div>
        <div>He half regretted that he came back.</div>
      </div>

      <div class="stanza">
        <div>For, had he waited, he might have wed</div>
        <div>Some maiden fair and thoroughbred;</div>
      </div>

      <div class="stanza">
        <div>For there be women fair as she,</div>
        <div>Whose verbs and nouns do more agree.</div>
      </div>

      <div class="stanza">
        <div>Alas for maiden! alas for judge!</div>
        <div>And the sentimental,&mdash;that's one-half 'fudge';</div>
      </div>

      <div class="stanza">
        <div>For Maud soon thought the judge a bore,</div>
        <div>With all his learning and all his lore.</div>
      </div>

      <div class="stanza">
        <div>And the judge would have bartered Maud's fair face</div>
        <div>For more refinement and social grace.</div>
      </div>

      <div class="stanza">
        <div>If, of all words of tongue and pen,</div>
        <div>The saddest are, 'It might have been,'</div>
      </div>

      <div class="stanza">
        <div>More sad are these we daily see:</div>
        <div>'It is, but hadn't ought to be.'</div>
      </div>
    </div>

        <div>The skies they were ashen and sober,</div>
        <div class="i1">The streets they were dirty and drear;</div>
        <div>It was night in the month of October,</div>
        <div class="i1">Of my most immemorial year;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">[345]</a></span></div>
        <div>Like the skies I was perfectly sober,</div>
        <div class="i1">As I stopped at the mansion of Shear,&mdash;</div>
        <div>At the Nightingale,&mdash;perfectly sober,</div>
        <div class="i1">And the willowy woodland, down here.</div>
      </div>

    <div class="stanza">
        <div>Here, once in an alley Titanic</div>
        <div class="i1">Of Ten-pins, I roamed with my soul,&mdash;</div>
        <div class="i1">Of Ten-pins,&mdash;with Mary, my soul;</div>
        <div>They were days when my heart was volcanic,</div>
        <div class="i1">And impelled me to frequently roll,</div>
        <div class="i1">And make me resistlessly roll,</div>
        <div>Till my ten-strikes created a panic</div>
        <div class="i1">In the realms of the Boreal pole,</div>
        <div>Till my ten-strikes created a panic</div>
        <div class="i1">With the monkey atop of his pole.</div>
    </div>

    <div class="stanza">
        <div>I repeat, I was perfectly sober,</div>
        <div class="i1">But my thoughts they were palsied and sere,&mdash;</div>
        <div class="i1">My thoughts were decidedly queer;</div>
        <div>For I knew not the month was October,</div>
        <div class="i1">And I marked not the night of the year,</div>
        <div>I forgot that sweet <i>morceau</i> of Auber</div>
        <div class="i1">That the band oft performed down here,</div>
        <div>And I mixed the sweet music of Auber</div>
        <div class="i1">With the Nightingale's music by Shear.</div>
    </div>

    <div class="stanza">
        <div>And now as the night was senescent,</div>
        <div class="i1">And the star-dials pointed to morn,</div>
        <div class="i1">And car-drivers hinted of morn,</div>
        <div>At the end of the path a liquescent</div>
        <div class="i1">And bibulous lustre was born;</div>
        <div>'Twas made by the bar-keeper present,</div>
        <div class="i1">Who mixéd a duplicate horn,&mdash;</div>
        <div>His two hands describing a crescent</div>
        <div class="i1">Distinct with a duplicate horn.</div>
    </div>

    <div class="stanza">
        <div>And I said: 'This looks perfectly regal,</div>

        <div class="i1">I am confident that I feel dry;</div>
        <div>We have come past the emu and eagle,</div>

        <div>Let us drink to the emu and eagle,&mdash;</div>
        <div class="i1">To the swan and the monkey on high,&mdash;</div>
        <div class="i1">To the eagle and monkey on high;</div>
        <div>For this bar-keeper will not inveigle,&mdash;</div>
        <div class="i1">Bully boy with the vitreous eye;</div>
        <div>He surely would never inveigle,&mdash;</div>
        <div class="i1">Sweet youth with the crystalline eye.'</div>
    </div>

    <div class="stanza">
        <div>But Mary, uplifting her finger,</div>
        <div class="i1">Said, 'Sadly this bar I mistrust,&mdash;</div>
        <div class="i1">I fear that this bar does not trust.</div>
        <div>O hasten! O let us not linger!</div>
        <div class="i1">O fly,&mdash;let us fly,&mdash;ere we must!'</div>
        <div>In terror she cried, letting sink her</div>
        <div class="i1">Parasol till it trailed in the dust,&mdash;</div>
        <div>In agony sobbed, letting sink her</div>
        <div class="i1">Parasol till it trailed in the dust,&mdash;</div>
        <div class="i1">Till it sorrowfully trailed in the dust.</div>
    </div>

    <div class="stanza">
        <div>Then I pacified Mary and kissed her,</div>
        <div class="i1">And tempted her into the room,</div>
        <div class="i1">And conquered her scruples and gloom;</div>
        <div>And we passed to the end of the vista,</div>
        <div class="i1">But were stopped by the warning of doom,&mdash;</div>
        <div class="i1">By some words that were warning of doom;</div>
        <div>And I said, 'What is written, sweet sister,</div>
        <div class="i1">At the opposite end of the room?'</div>
        <div>She sobbed, as she answered, 'All liquors</div>
        <div class="i1">Must be paid for ere leaving the room.'</div>
    </div>

    <div class="stanza">
        <div>Then my heart it grew ashen and sober,</div>
        <div class="i1">As the streets were deserted and drear,&mdash;</div>
        <div class="i1">For my pockets were empty and drear;</div>
        <div>And I cried, 'It was surely October,</div>
        <div class="i1">On this very night of last year,</div>
        <div class="i1">That I journeyed&mdash;I journeyed down here,&mdash;</div>
        <div class="i1">That I brought a fair maiden down here,</div>
        <div class="i1">On this night of all nights in the year.</div>
        <div class="i1">Ah! to me that inscription is clear;</div>
        <div>Well I know now, I'm perfectly sober,</div>
        <div class="i1">Why no longer they credit me here,&mdash;</div>
        <div>Well I know now that music of Auber,</div>
        <div class="i1">And this Nightingale, kept by one Shear.'</div>

        <div>Upon April the First</div>

    <div class="stanza">
        <div>The candidates came</div>
        <div class="i1">And Tom Crib soon appeared;</div>
        <div>It was Euclid. The same</div>
        <div class="i1">Was 'the subject he feared,'</div>
        <div>But he smiled as he sat by the table</div>
        <div class="i1">With a smile that was wary and weird.</div>
    </div>

    <div class="stanza">
        <div>Yet he did what he could,</div>
        <div class="i1">And the papers he showed</div>

    <div class="stanza">
        <div>We did not find him out,</div>

        <div>A stiff paper was set</div>
        <div class="i1">By Examiner U...</div>
        <div>On Euripides' tragedy, Bacchae.</div>

        <div>But the knowledge displayed</div>
        <div class="i1">By that heathen Pass-ee,</div>
        <div>And the answers he made</div>
        <div class="i1">Were quite frightful to see,</div>
        <div>For he rapidly floored the whole paper</div>
        <div class="i1">By about twenty minutes to three.</div>
    </div>

    <div class="stanza">
        <div>Then I looked up at U...</div>

        <div>I observed, 'This won't do.'</div>
        <div class="i1">He replied, 'Goodness me!</div>
        <div>We are fooled by this artful young person,'</div>
        <div class="i1">And he sent for that heathen Pass-ee.</div>
    </div>

    <div class="stanza">
        <div>The scene that ensued</div>
        <div class="i1">Was disgraceful to view,</div>
        <div>For the floor it was strewed</div>
        <div class="i1">With a tolerable few</div>
        <div>Of the 'tips' that Tom Crib had been hiding</div>
        <div class="i1">For the 'subject he partially knew.'</div>
    </div>

    <div class="stanza">
        <div>On the cuff of his shirt</div>
        <div class="i1">He had managed to get</div>
        <div>What we hoped had been dirt,</div>
        <div class="i1">But which proved, I regret,</div>
        <div>To be notes on the rise of the Drama,</div>
        <div class="i1">A question invariably set.</div>
    </div>

    <div class="stanza">
        <div>In his various coats</div>
        <div class="i1">We proceeded to seek,</div>
        <div>Where we found sundry notes</div>
        <div class="i1">And&mdash;with sorrow I speak&mdash;</div>
        <div>One of Bohn's publications, so useful</div>
        <div class="i1">To the student of Latin or Greek.</div>
    </div>

        <div>In the crown of his cap</div>

        <div class="i1">Of the Dorian States,</div>

1. The brown-stone house; the father coming home
worried from a bad day's business; the wife meets
him in the marble-pav'd vestibule; she throws
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_371" id="Page_371">[371]</a></span>her arms about him; she presses him close to her;
she looks him full in the face with affectionate
eyes; the frown from his brow disappearing.</div>
        <div class="hangingindent1"><i>Darling, she says, Johnny has fallen down and cut
his head; the cook is going away, and the boiler
leaks.</i></div>
        <div class="hangingindent">2. The mechanic's dark little third story room, seen in
a flash from the Elevated Railway train; the
sewing-machine in a corner; the small cook-stove;
the whole family eating cabbage around a kerosene
lamp; of the clatter and roar and groaning
wail of the Elevated train unconscious; of the
smell of the cabbage unconscious.</div>
        <div class="hangingindent1">Me, passant, in the train, of the cabbage not quite
so unconscious.</div>
        <div class="hangingindent">3. The French flat; the small rooms, all right angles,
unindividual; the narrow halls; the gaudy cheap
decorations everywhere.</div>
        <div class="hangingindent">The janitor and the cook exchanging compliments
up and down the elevator-shaft; the refusal to
send up more coal, the solid splash of the water
upon his head, the language he sends up the shaft,
the triumphant laughter of the cook, to her
kitchen retiring.</div>
        <div class="hangingindent">4. The widow's small house in the suburbs of the city;
the widow's boy coming home from his first day
down town; he is flushed with happiness and
pride; he is no longer a school-boy, he is earning
money; he takes on the airs of a man and talks
learnedly of business.</div>
        <div class="hangingindent">5. The room in the third-class boarding-house; the
mean little hard-coal fire, the slovenly Irish servant-girl
making it, the ashes on the hearth, the
faded furniture, the private provender hid away
in the closet, the dreary back-yard out the window;
the young girl at the glass, with her mouth
full of hair-pins, doing up her hair to go downstairs
and flirt with the young fellows in the
parlour.</div>
        <div class="hangingindent">6. The kitchen of the old farm-house; the young convict
just return'd from prison&mdash;it was his first
offence, and the judges were lenient to him.</div>
        <div class="hangingindent1">He is taking his first meal out of prison; he has
been receiv'd back, kiss'd, encourag'd to start
again; his lungs, his nostrils expand with the big
breaths of free air; with shame, with wonderment,
with a trembling joy, his heart too expanding.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_372" id="Page_372">[372]</a></span></div>
        <div class="hangingindent1">The old mother busies herself about the table; she
has ready for him the dishes he us'd to like; the
father sits with his back to them, reading the
newspaper, the newspaper shaking and rustling
much; the children hang wondering around the
prodigal&mdash;&mdash;they have been caution'd: <i>Do not ask
where our Jim has been; only say you are glad to
see him</i>.</div>
        <div class="hangingindent1">The elder daughter is there, pale-fac'd, quiet; her
young man went back on her four years ago; his
folks would not let him marry a convict's sister.
She sits by the window, sewing on the children's
clothes, the clothes not only patching up; her
hunger for children of her own invisibly patching
up.</div>
        <div class="hangingindent1">The brother looks up; he catches her eye, he fearful,
apologetic; she smiles back at him, not reproachfully
smiling, with loving pretence of hope smiling
&mdash;it is too much for him; he buries his face in the
folds of the mother's black gown.</div>
        <div class="hangingindent">7. The best room of the house, on the Sabbath only
open'd; the smell of horse-hair furniture and
mahogany varnish; the ornaments on the whatnot
in the corner; the wax-fruit, dusty, sunken,
sagged in, consumptive-looking, under a glass
globe; the sealing-wax imitation of coral; the
cigar boxes with shells plastered over; the perforated
card-board motto.</div>
        <div class="hangingindent1">The kitchen; the housewife sprinkling the clothes
for the fine ironing to-morrow&mdash;it is Third-day
night, and the plain things are already iron'd, now
in cupboards, in drawers stowed away.</div>
        <div class="hangingindent1">The wife waiting for the husband&mdash;he is at the
tavern, jovial, carousing; she, alone in the kitchen
sprinkling clothes&mdash;the little red wood clock with
peaked top, with pendulum wagging behind a
pane of gaily painted glass, strikes twelve.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_373" id="Page_373">[373]</a></span></div>
        <div class="hangingindent1">The sound of the husband's voice on the still night
air&mdash;he is singing: <i>We won't go home till morning!</i>
&mdash;the wife arising, toward the wood-shed hastily
going, stealthily entering, the voice all the time
coming nearer, inebriate, chantant.</div>
        <div class="hangingindent1">The wood-shed; the club behind the door of the
wood-shed; the wife annexing the club; the husband
approaching, always inebriate, chantant.</div>
        <div class="hangingindent1">The husband passing the door of the wood-shed;
the club over his head, now with his head in contact;
the sudden cessation of the song; the temperance
pledge signed the next morning; the
benediction of peace over the domestic foyer
temporarily resting.</div>

<h2>NOTES</h2>


<p><a href="#Page_1">P. 1.</a> <i>Rejected Addresses.</i> First published anonymously in the
autumn of 1812. The authors, James Smith (1775-1839) and Horace
Smith (1779-1849) were brothers, the former a solicitor, the latter
a stockbroker. James wrote a number of 'entertainments' for Charles
Mathews, who described him as 'the only man in London who can
write good nonsense.' Horace wrote more than a score of novels and
collections of stories, of which, perhaps, <i>Brambletye House</i> is the
best remembered. It was of him that Shelley wrote, in the <i>Letter to
Maria Gisborne</i>:</p>

<p>How the <i>Rejected Addresses</i> came to be written is told in the authors'
prefaces:</p>


<h3>PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION.</h3>

<p>On the 14th of August, 1812, the following advertisement appeared in
most of the daily papers:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote class="smaller">

<p class="center p-left">'<i>Rebuilding of Drury Lane Theatre.</i></p>

<p>'The Committee are desirous of promoting a free and fair
competition for an Address to be spoken upon the opening of
the Theatre, which will take place on the 10th of October
next. They have, therefore, thought fit to announce to
the public, that they will be glad to receive any such
compositions, addressed to their Secretary, at the Treasury
Office, in Drury Lane, on or before the 10th of September,
sealed up; with a distinguishing word, number, or motto, on
the cover, corresponding with the inscription on a separate
sealed paper, containing the name of the author, which will
not be opened unless containing the name of the successful
candidate.'</p>

<p>Upon the propriety of this plan, men's minds were, as they
usually are upon matters of moment, much divided. Some thought
it a fair promise of the future intention of the Committee to
abolish that phalanx of authors who usurp the stage, to the
exclusion of a large assortment of dramatic talent blushing
unseen in the background; while others contended, that the
scheme would prevent men of real eminence from descending into
an amphitheatre in which all Grub Street (that is to say, all
London and Westminster) would be arrayed against them. The
event has proved both parties to be in a degree<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_394" id="Page_394">[394]</a></span> right, and in
a degree wrong. One hundred and twelve 'Addresses' have been
sent in, each sealed and signed, and mottoed, 'as per order,'
some written by men of great, some by men of little, and some
by men of no, talent.</p>

<p>Many of the public prints have censured the taste of the
Committee, in thus contracting for 'Addresses,' as they would
for nails&mdash;by the gross; but it is surprising that none should
have censured their <i>temerity</i>. One hundred and eleven of the
'Addresses' must, of course, be unsuccessful: to each of the
authors, thus infallibly classed with the <i>genus irritabile</i>,
it would be very hard to deny six staunch friends, who
consider his the best of all possible 'Addresses,' and
whose tongues will be as ready to laud him, as to hiss his
adversary. These, with the potent aid of the Bard himself,
make seven foes per Address; and thus will be created seven
hundred and seventy-seven implacable auditors, prepared to
condemn the strains of Apollo himself&mdash;a band of adversaries
which no prudent manager would think of exasperating.</p>

<p>But, leaving the Committee to encounter the responsibility
they have incurred, the public have at least to thank them
for ascertaining and establishing one point, which might
otherwise have admitted of controversy. When it is considered
that many amateur writers have been discouraged from becoming
competitors, and that few, if any, of the professional authors
can afford to write for nothing, and, of course, have not
been candidates for the honorary prize at Drury Lane, we may
confidently pronounce that, as far as regards <span class="smcap">NUMBER</span>,
the present is undoubtedly the Augustan age of English
poetry. Whether or not this distinction will be extended to
the <span class="smcap">QUALITY</span> of its productions, must be decided at
the tribunal of posterity; though the natural anxiety of our
authors on this score ought to be considerably diminished when
they reflect how few will, in all probability, be had up for
judgement.</p>

<p>It is not necessary for the Editor to mention the manner
in which he became possessed of this 'fair sample of the
present state of poetry in Great Britain.' It was his first
intention to publish the whole; but a little reflection
convinced him that, by so doing, he might depress the good,
without elevating the bad. He has therefore culled what had
the appearance of flowers, from what possessed the reality
of weeds, and is extremely sorry that, in so doing, he has
diminished his collection to twenty-one. Those which he has
rejected may possibly make their appearance in a separate
volume, or they may be admitted as volunteers in the files
of some of the Newspapers; or, at all events, they are sure
of being received among the awkward squad of the Magazines.
In general, they bear a close resemblance to each other;
thirty of them contain extravagant compliments to the immortal
Wellington and the indefatigable Whitbread; and, as the
last-mentioned gentleman is said to dislike praise in the
exact proportion in which he deserves it, these laudatory
writers may have been only building a wall against which they
might run their own heads.</p>

<p>The Editor here begs leave to advance a few words in behalf
of that useful and much abused bird the Phœnix; and in
so doing he is biased by no partiality, as he assures the
reader he not only never<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_395" id="Page_395">[395]</a></span> saw one, but (<i>mirabile dictu!</i>)
never caged one in a simile in the whole course of his life.
Not less than sixty-nine of the competitors have invoked the
aid of this native of Arabia; but as, from their manner of
using him after they had caught him, he does not by any means
appear to have been a native of <i>Arabia Felix</i>, the Editor has
left the proprietors to treat with Mr. Polito, and refused
to receive this <i>rara avis</i>, or black swan, into the present
collection. One exception occurs, in which the admirable
treatment of this feathered incombustible, entitles the author
to great praise; that address has been preserved, and was
thought worthy of taking the lead.</p>

<p>Perhaps the reason why several of the subjoined productions
of the <span class="smcap">Musæ Londinenses</span> have failed of selection,
may be discovered in their being penned in a metre unusual
upon occasions of this sort, and in their not being written
with that attention to stage effect, the want of which, like
want of manners in the concerns of life, is more prejudicial
than a deficiency of talent. There is an art of writing for
the Theatre, technically called <i>touch and go</i>, which is
indispensable when we consider the small quantum of patience
which so motley an assemblage as a London audience can be
expected to afford. All the contributors have been very exact
in sending their initials and mottoes. Those belonging to the
present collection have been carefully preserved, and each
has been affixed to its respective poem. The letters that
accompanied the Addresses having been honourably destroyed
unopened, it is impossible to state the real authors with
any certainty; but the ingenious reader, after comparing the
initials with the motto, and both with the poem will form his
own conclusions.</p>

<p>We do not anticipate any disapprobation from thus giving
publicity to a small portion of the <i>Rejected Addresses</i>; for
unless we are widely mistaken in assigning the respective
authors, the fame of each Individual is established on much
too firm a basis to be shaken by so trifling and evanescent a
publication as the present:</p>

  <div class="poetry-container">
    <div class="poetry">
      <div class="stanza">
        <div class="i2">&mdash;&mdash;neque ego illi detrahere ausim</div>
        <div>Hærentem capiti multa cum laude coronam.</div>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>

<p>Of the numerous pieces already sent to the Committee for
performance, we have only availed ourselves of three vocal
Travesties, which we have selected, not for their merit,
but simply for their brevity. Above one hundred spectacles,
melodramas, operas, and pantomimes have been transmitted,
besides the two first acts of one legitimate comedy. Some
of these evince considerable smartness of manual dialogue,
and several brilliant repartees of chairs, tables, and other
inanimate wits; but the authors seem to have forgotten that in
the new Drury Lane the audience can hear as well as see. Of
late our theatres have been so constructed, that John Bull has
been compelled to have very long ears, or none at all; to keep
them dangling about his skull like discarded servants, while
his eyes were gazing at piebalds and elephants, or else to
stretch them out to an asinine length to catch the congenial
sound of braying trumpets. An auricular revolution is, we
trust, about to take place; and as many people have been much
puzzled to define the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_396" id="Page_396">[396]</a></span> meaning of the new era, of which we
have heard so much, we venture to pronounce, that as far as
regards Drury Lane Theatre, the new era means the reign of
ears. If the past affords any pledge for the future, we may
confidently expect from the Committee of that House everything
that can be accomplished by the union of taste and assiduity.</p></blockquote>

<p>The text of the <i>Rejected Addresses</i> here given is that of the
eighteenth edition with Horace Smith's annotations. The footnotes from
the <i>Edinburgh Review</i> were taken from an article by Lord Jeffrey in
the number for November, 1812. It may be mentioned that the actual
addresses sent in to the Drury Lane Committee are preserved with
their covering letters in the Manuscript Department of the British
Museum, and that on the immediate success of the Smiths' parodies an
enterprising publisher issued a volume of <i>Genuine Rejected Addresses</i>
from the forty-three competitors who responded to his appeal for such.</p>

<p>The following is from the Preface to the eighteenth edition:</p>

<blockquote class="smaller">

<p>Our first difficulty, that of selection, was by no means a
light one. Some of our most eminent poets, such, for instance,
as Rogers and Campbell, presented so much beauty, harmony, and
proportion in their writings, both as to style and sentiment,
that if we had attempted to caricature them, nobody would
have recognized the likeness; and if we had endeavoured to
give a servile copy of their manner, it would only have
amounted, at best, to a tame and unamusing portrait, which
it was not our object to present. Although fully aware that
their names would, in the theatrical phrase, have conferred
great strength upon our bill, we were reluctantly compelled
to forgo them, and to confine ourselves to writers whose
style and habit of thought, being more marked and peculiar,
was more capable of exaggeration and distortion. To avoid
politics and personality, to imitate the turn of mind, as
well as the phraseology of our originals, and, at all events,
to raise a harmless laugh, were our main objects: in the
attainment of which united aims, we were sometimes hurried
into extravagance, by attaching much more importance to the
last than to the two first. In no instance were we thus
betrayed into a greater injustice than in the case of Mr.
Wordsworth&mdash;the touching sentiment, profound wisdom, and
copious harmony of whose loftier writings we left unnoticed,
in the desire of burlesquing them; while we pounced upon
his popular ballads, and exerted ourselves to push their
simplicity into puerility and silliness. With pride find
pleasure do we now claim to be ranked among the most ardent
admirers of this true poet; and if he himself could see the
state of his works, which are ever at our right hand, he
would, perhaps, receive the manifest evidences they exhibit of
constant reference, and delighted re-perusal, as some sort of
<i>amende honorable</i> for the unfairness of which we were guilty,
when we were less conversant with the higher inspirations of
his muse. To Mr. Coleridge, and others of our originals, we
must also do a tardy act of justice, by declaring that our
burlesque of their peculiarities, has never<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_397" id="Page_397">[397]</a></span> blinded us to
those beauties and talents which are beyond the reach of all
ridicule.</p>

<p>One of us had written a genuine Address for the occasion,
which was sent to the Committee, and shared the fate it
merited, in being rejected. To swell the bulk, or rather to
diminish the tenuity of our little work, we added it to the
Imitations; and prefixing the initials of S. T. P. for the
purpose of puzzling the critics, were not a little amused, in
the sequel, by the many guesses and conjectures into which
we had ensnared some of our readers. We could even enjoy the
mysticism, qualified as it was by the poor compliment, that
our carefully written Address exhibited no 'very prominent
trait of absurdity,' when we saw it thus noticed in the
<i>Edinburgh Review</i> for November, 1812. 'An Address by S. T.
P. we can make nothing of; and professing our ignorance of
the author designated by these letters, we can only add, that
the Address, though a little affected, and not very full of
meaning, has no very prominent trait of absurdity, that we
can detect; and might have been adopted and spoken, so far
as we can perceive, without any hazard of ridicule. In our
simplicity we consider it as a very decent, mellifluous,
occasional prologue; and do not understand how it has found
its way into its present company.'</p>

<p>Urged forward by hurry, and trusting to chance, two very bad
coadjutors in any enterprise, we at length congratulated
ourselves on having completed our task in time to have
it printed and published by the opening of the theatre.
But, alas! our difficulties, so far from being surmounted,
seemed only to be beginning. Strangers to the arcana of
the bookseller's trade, and unacquainted with their almost
invincible objection to single volumes of low price,
especially when tendered by writers who have acquired no
previous name, we little anticipated that they would refuse
to publish our <i>Rejected Addresses</i>, even although we asked
nothing for the copyright. Such however, proved to be the
case. Our manuscript was perused and returned to us by several
of the most eminent publishers. Well do we remember betaking
ourselves to one of the craft in Bond Street, whom we found in
a back parlour, with his gouty leg propped upon a cushion, in
spite of which warning he diluted his luncheon with frequent
glasses of Madeira. 'What have you already written?' was
his first question, an interrogatory to which we had been
subjected in almost every instance. 'Nothing by which we can
be known.' 'Then I am afraid to undertake the publication.'
We presumed timidly to suggest that every writer must have
a beginning, and that to refuse to publish for him until he
had acquired a name, was to imitate the sapient mother who
cautioned her son against going into the water until he could
swim. 'An old joke&mdash;a regular Joe!' exclaimed our companion,
tossing off another bumper. 'Still older than Joe Miller,'
was our reply; 'for, if we mistake not, it is the very first
anecdote in the facetiæ of Hierocles.' 'Ha, sirs!' resumed
the bibliopolist, 'you are learned, are you? So, soh!&mdash;Well,
leave your manuscript with me; I will look it over to-night,
and give you an answer to-morrow.' Punctual as the clock we
presented ourselves at his door on the following morning, when
our papers were returned to us with the observation&mdash;'These
trifles are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_398" id="Page_398">[398]</a></span> really not deficient in smartness; they are well,
vastly well for beginners; but they will never do&mdash;never. They
would not pay for advertising, and without it I should not
sell fifty copies.'</p>

<p>This was discouraging enough. If the most experienced
publishers feared to be out of pocket by the work, it was
manifest, <i>a fortiori</i>, that its writers ran a risk of being
still more heavy losers, should they undertake the publication
on their own account. We had no objection to raise a laugh
at the expense of others; but to do it at our own cost,
uncertain as we were to what extent we might be involved, had
never entered into our contemplation. In this dilemma, our
<i>Addresses</i>, now in every sense rejected, might probably have
never seen the light, had not some good angel whispered us to
betake ourselves to Mr. John Miller, a dramatic publisher,
then residing in Bow Street, Covent Garden. No sooner had this
gentleman looked over our manuscript, than he immediately
offered to take upon himself all the risk of publication,
and to give us half the profits, <i>should there be any</i>; a
liberal proposition, with which we gladly closed. So rapid and
decided was its success, at which none were more unfeignedly
astonished than its authors, that Mr. Miller advised us to
collect some <i>Imitations of Horace</i>, which had appeared
anonymously in the <i>Monthly Mirror</i>, offering to publish
them upon the same terms. We did so accordingly; and as new
editions of the <i>Rejected Addresses</i> were called for in quick
succession, we were shortly enabled to sell our half copyright
in the two works to Mr. Miller, for one thousand pounds!! We
have entered into this unimportant detail, not to gratify any
vanity of our own, but to encourage such literary beginners as
may be placed in similar circumstances; as well as to impress
upon publishers the propriety of giving more consideration to
the possible merit of the works submitted to them, than to the
mere magic of a name.</p>

<p>To the credit of the <i>genus irritabile</i> be it recorded, that
not one of those whom we had parodied or burlesqued ever
betrayed the least soreness on the occasion, or refused to
join in the laugh that we had occasioned. With most of them
we subsequently formed acquaintanceship; while some honoured
us with an intimacy which still continues, where it has not
been severed by the rude hand of Death. Alas! it is painful
to reflect, that of the twelve writers whom we presumed to
imitate, five are now no more; the list of the deceased
being unhappily swelled by the most illustrious of all, the
<i>clarum et venerabile nomen</i> of Sir Walter Scott! From that
distinguished writer, whose transcendent talents were only to
be equalled by his virtues and his amiability, we received
favours and notice, both public and private, which it will
be difficult to forget, because we had not the smallest
claim upon his kindness. 'I certainly must have written this
myself!' said that fine-tempered man to one of the authors,
pointing to the description of the Fire, 'although I forget
upon what occasion.' Lydia White, a literary lady, who was
prone to feed the lions of the day, invited one of us to
dinner; but, recollecting afterwards that William Spencer
formed one of the party, wrote to the latter to put him off;
telling him that a man was to be at her table whom he 'would
not like to meet.' 'Pray who is this whom I should not like
to meet?' inquired the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_399" id="Page_399">[399]</a></span> poet. 'Oh!' answered the lady, 'one
of those men who have made that shameful attack upon you!'
'The very man upon earth I should like to know!' rejoined the
lively and careless bard. The two individuals accordingly met,
and have continued fast friends, ever since. Lord Byron, too,
wrote thus to Mr. Murray from Italy&mdash;'Tell him we forgive him,
were he twenty times our satirist.'</p>

<p>It may not be amiss to notice, in this place, one criticism of
a Leicestershire clergyman, which may be pronounced unique: 'I
do not see why they should have been rejected,' observed the
matter-of-fact annotator; 'I think some of them very good!'</p></blockquote>

<p><a href="#Page_29">P. 29.</a> <i>Laura Matilda.</i> Horace Smith, the author of <i>Drury's Dirge</i>,
wrote that 'the authors, as in gallantly bound, wish this lady to
continue anonymous,' and as a consequence there have been several
attempts to pierce the veil of anonymity. One annotator boldly 'assumes
the lady to have been' Letitia Elizabeth Landon (1802-1836), who was
ten years of age when the <i>Rejected Addresses</i> were published. The
motto from <i>The Baviad</i> which stands at the head of the parody is
sufficient indication that the original was to be found among the
'Della Cruscans,' whose 'namby-pamby' verses, after appearing in the
<i>World</i>, were published in two volumes as <i>The British Album</i> in 1790
(see the note on p. 405). The chief lady among those sentimentals was
'Anna Matilda,' otherwise Hannah Cowley (1743-1809), a dramatist of
considerable, and a poet of but little, ability. As Mrs. Cowley had
died three years before the Addresses were sent in, it is probable
either that the parodists did not know of her death or that they merely
meant to make fun of the school of which she was a leader. The passage
from Gifford's <i>Baviad</i> given by way of motto is taken from that part
of the satire in which the writers of <i>The British Album</i> are more
particularly castigated.</p>

authorities Pitt is credited with the last verse), having in mind
Pitt's friend, Sir Robert Adair, who was educated at Göttingen. The
editors of the <i>Anti-Jacobin</i> say: 'The song of Rogero with which the

<blockquote class="smaller">

<p class="p-left">'in ridicule of my own Poems, and Charles Lloyd's and Lamb's,
etc., etc., exposing that affectation of unaffectedness, of
jumping and misplaced accent in commonplace epithets, flat
lines forced into poetry by italics (signifying how well and
mouthishly the author would read them), puny pathos, etc.,
etc. The instances were almost all taken from myself and Lloyd
and Lamb.'</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_405" id="Page_405">[405]</a></span></p>

<p>The first sonnet, Coleridge said,</p>

<blockquote class="smaller">

<p class="p-left">had for its object to excite a good-natured laugh at the spirit of
doleful egotism and at the recurrence of favourite phrases, with the
double object of being at once trite and licentious. The second was on
low creeping language and thoughts under the pretence of <i>simplicity</i>.
[Lamb had written some months earlier, 'Cultivate simplicity,
Coleridge.'] The third, the phrases of which were borrowed entirely
from my own poems, on the indiscriminate use of elaborate and swelling
language and imagery.... So general at that time and so decided was
the opinion concerning the characteristic vices of my style that a
celebrated physician (now, alas! no more) speaking of me in other
respects with his usual kindness to a gentleman who was about to meet
me at a dinner-party could not, however, resist giving him a hint not
to mention <i>The House that Jack Built</i> in my presence, for that I was
as sore as a boil about that sonnet, he not knowing that I was myself
the author of it. (<i>See</i> the Oxford Coleridge.)</p></blockquote>

<p><a href="#Page_144">P. 144.</a> <i>Amatory Poems.</i> It is curious that Southey, who had taken
offence at Coleridge's sonnet <i>To Simplicity</i>, signed 'Nehemiah
Higginbottom,' believing it directed against himself, should
himself have turned parodist and adopted the similar name of 'Abel
Shufflebottom' a couple of years later. Coleridge wrote, so he
declared, that he might do the young poets good; Southey, it may
be believed, merely to make fun of that band of vain and foolish
versifiers who came to be known as 'the Della Cruscans.' Haunters
of the book-stalls may yet occasionally light upon two small volumes
entitled <i>The British Album, containing the Poems of Della Crusca, Anna
Matilda, Arley, Benedict, the Bard, etc., etc. Which were originally
published under the Title of the Poetry of the World, revised and
corrected by the Respective Authors</i>. The second edition was dated
1790, and the work was still current when the brothers Smith gave their
Laura Matilda parody in the <i>Rejected Addresses</i> (see p. 29). A few
stanzas of one of 'Della Crusca's' poems addressed to 'Anna Matilda'
will suffice to indicate the stuff which Southey was satirising:</p>

than of manner, it has echoes of Burton's <i>Abstract of Melancholy</i>,
which prefaces the <i>Anatomy</i>.</p>

<p><a href="#Page_154">P. 154.</a> <i>Nonsense Verses.</i> Here Lamb parodies the sentiment which had

<p>nothing personal to the author of <i>Peter Bell</i> is intended

appreciate its beauties.... His idea was that a man gifted,
even as transcendently as the author of <i>Peter Bell</i>, with
the highest qualities of genius, must, if he fostered such
errors, be infected with dullness. This poem was written as a
warning&mdash;not as a narration of reality. He was unacquainted
personally with Wordsworth, or with Coleridge (to whom he
alludes in the fifth part of the poem), and therefore, I

wrote&mdash;it is said in a single day&mdash;this <i>Lyrical Ballad</i> and hurried
it out before Wordsworth's poem was issued. The fact that
Reynolds used Wordsworth's measure suggests that he had seen
a copy of the original. It was a criticism by Leigh Hunt of
Wordsworth's <i>Peter Bell</i> and Reynolds' parody that moved
Shelley to the writing of <i>Peter Bell the Third</i>. To his <i>Peter Bell</i>
Reynolds attached a <i>Preface</i> and a short <i>Supplementary Essay</i>,
also purporting to be written by W. W.</p>

<blockquote class="smaller">

<p>'It is now (the <i>Preface</i> began) a period of one-and-twenty years
since I first wrote some of the most perfect compositions (except
certain pieces I have written in my later days) that ever dropped
from poetical pen.... It has been my aim and my achievement
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_410" id="Page_410">[410]</a></span>to deduce moral thunder from buttercups, daisies, celandines, and
(as a poet scarcely inferior to myself, hath it) "such small deer."
Out of sparrows' eggs I have hatched great truths, and with sextons'
barrows have I wheeled into human hearts piles of the weightiest
philosophy.... Of <i>Peter Bell</i> I have only thus much to say: It
completes the simple system of natural narrative, which I began so
early as 1798. It is written in that pure unlaboured style, which
can only be met with among labourers.... I commit my Ballad
confidently to posterity. I love to read my own poetry: it does
my heart good.'</p></blockquote>

<p>it was precisely the poets whom we most admired that we
imitated the most frequently. This was certainly not from
any want of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_413" id="Page_413">[413]</a></span> reverence, but rather out of the fullness of
our admiration, just as the excess of a lover's fondness
often runs over into raillery of the very qualities that are
dearest to his heart. 'Let no one,' says Heine, 'ridicule
mankind unless he loves them.' With no less truth may it be
said, Let no one parody a poet unless he loves him. He must
first be penetrated by his spirit, and have steeped his ear in
the music of his verse, before he can reflect these under a
humorous aspect with success.</p></blockquote>

<p><a href="#Page_353">Pp. 353-7.</a> <i>Andrew Lang.</i> The parodies on the Rossetti and Morris
styles are taken from Andrew Lang's essay on Thomas Haynes Bayly in
<i>Essays in Little</i>. 'Bayly,' Mr. Lang wrote, in discussing 'Oh, no, we
never mention her,' 'had now struck the note, the sweet sentimental
note, of the early, innocent, Victorian age.... We should do the trick
quite differently now, more like this.' Here follows 'Love spake to
me,' of which its author says at the end:</p>

<blockquote class="smaller">

<p>I declare I nearly weep over these lines; for, though they
are only Bayly's sentiment hastily recast in a modern manner,
there is something so very affecting, mouldy, and unwholesome
about them that they sound as if they had been 'written up to'
a sketch by a disciple of Mr. Rossetti's.</p></blockquote>

<p class="p-left">Mr. Lang says, 'Any one of us could get in more local colour
for the money, and give the crusader a cithern or citole
instead of a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_419" id="Page_419">[419]</a></span> guitar,' and in proof gives the 'romantic,
esoteric, old French poem, "Sir Ralph."'</p>

<p>The two Swinburne parodies are from <i>Rhymes à la Mode</i>, 1895.
An earlier <i>Ballade</i>, of which that on p. 35 'is an improved
version, was printed in the <i>St. James's Gazette</i> in 1881. The
original of this is Swinburne's 'A Ballad of Burdens'; of 'The
Palace of Bric-a-brac,' 'The Garden of Proserpine':</p>

parody is said to have been an impromptu. It is taken from <i>New

<p>The original of 'Octopus' was clearly 'Dolores,' which appeared in
<i>Poems and Ballads, First Series</i>, 1866. The fourth stanza of this,
with which may be compared the fifth stanza of 'Octopus,' runs:</p>

Arcady</i>, 1885, by permission of Messrs. Charles Scribner's Sons.</p>

<p><a href="#Page_374">P. 374.</a> <i>Ode on a Retrospect.</i> This Ode was put into the mouth of an
Eton master named Joynes. Being a Liberal with Nationalist sympathies,
he visited a disturbed district in the North of Ireland (presumably
in the summer of 1882), and contrived to get himself arrested, and
imprisoned for a short time. He then wrote a book or pamphlet on the
subject, with the result indicated in the verses, which seem to point
to his having withdrawn his work rather than resign his appointment.
Mr. Joynes still held his mastership when the <i>Retrospect</i> was
published in November, 1882, and the popularity of the piece at Eton
was prodigious, especially the admirable line, 'They snatched a fearful
Joynes.'</p>

<p><a href="#Page_378">P. 378.</a> <i>To A. T. M.</i> 'The K.' was the 'A. T. M.' to whom the piece
is addressed&mdash;A. T. Myers (Arthur, a physician of some eminence), the
youngest brother of the poet parodied. Sir<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_420" id="Page_420">[420]</a></span> Herbert Stephen (by whose
permission his brother's parodies, from <i>Lapsus Calami</i>, are given)
states that in the early days of the Society for Psychical Research,
founded by F. W. H. Myers, and of the study of the newly-named
'telepathy,' such experiments were frequently tried by the members, and
he thinks it highly probable that the incident of Arthur Myers taking
peppermint in order to test the ability of an alleged telepathist
'in quite another room' to say what it was, took place in fact as
described. 'The K.' was a nickname by which A. T. M. was very generally
known among his friends and relations: the reason is obscure.</p>

of the <i>Rubaiyat</i> was first printed in Mr. E. V. Lucas's <i>One Day with

personal knowledge of this gentleman was at Harry Greville's Pic-Nic
Theatre, in Tottenham Street, where he personated Zanga in a wig too
small for his head. The second time of seeing him was at the table of
old Lord Dudley, who familiarly called him Fitz, but forgot to name him
in his will. The Earl's son (recently deceased), however, liberally
supplied the omission by a donation of five thousand pounds. The third
and last time of encountering him was at an anniversary dinner of the
Literary Fund, at the Freemasons' Tavern. Both parties, as two of the
stewards, met their brethren in a small room about half an hour before
dinner. The lampooner, out of delicacy, kept aloof from the poet. The
latter, however, made up to him, when the following dialogue took place:</p>

<p>Fitzgerald (with good humour): 'Mr.&mdash;&mdash;, I mean to recite after dinner.'</p>

<p>Mr.&mdash;&mdash;: 'Do you?'</p>

<p>Fitzgerald: 'Yes; you'll have more of "God bless the Regent and the
Duke of York!"'</p>

<p>The whole of this imitation, after a lapse of twenty years, appears to
the Authors too personal and sarcastic; but they may shelter themselves
under a very broad mantle:</p>

<p>Fitzgerald actually sent in an address to the committee on the 31st
of August, 1812. It was published among the other genuine <i>Rejected
Addresses</i>, in one volume, in that year. The following is an extract:&mdash;</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_6_6" id="Footnote_6_6"></a><a href="#FNanchor_6_6"><span class="label">[6]</span></a> Jack and Nancy, as it was afterwards remarked to
the Authors, are here made to come into the world at periods not
sufficiently remote. The writers were then bachelors. One of them,
unfortunately, still continues so, as he has thus recorded in his
niece's album:</p>

  <div class="poetry-container">
    <div class="poetry">
      <div class="stanza">
        <div class="i1">'Should I seek Hymen's tie,</div>

        <div class="i1">Is annexed to my name</div>
        <div>Is derived from <i>Rejected Addresses</i>.'</div>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>

<p>The blunder, notwithstanding, remains unrectified. The reader of poetry
is always dissatisfied with emendations: they sound discordantly upon
the ear, like a modern song, by Bishop or Braham, introduced in <i>Love
in a Village</i>.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_7_7" id="Footnote_7_7"></a><a href="#FNanchor_7_7"><span class="label">[7]</span></a> This alludes to the young Betty mania. The writer was in
the stage-box at the height of this young gentleman's popularity. One
of the other occupants offered, in a loud voice, to prove that young
Betty did not understand Shakespeare. 'Silence!' was the cry; but he
still proceeded. 'Turn him out!' was the next ejaculation. He still
vociferated 'He does not understand Shakespeare;' and was consequently
shouldered into the lobby. 'I'll prove it to you,' said the critic
to the door-keeper. 'Prove what, sir?' 'That he does not understand
Shakespeare.' This was Molière's housemaid with a vengeance!
</p>
<p>
Young Betty may now be seen walking about town&mdash;a portly personage,
aged about forty&mdash;clad in a furred and frogged surtout; probably
muttering to himself (as he has been at college), 'O mihi præteritos!'
&amp;c.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_10_10" id="Footnote_10_10"></a><a href="#FNanchor_10_10"><span class="label">[10]</span></a> This would seem to show that poet and prophet are
synonymous, the noble bard having afterwards returned to England, and
again quitted it, under domestic circumstances painfully notorious.
His good-humoured forgiveness of the Authors has been already alluded
to in the Preface. Nothing of this illustrious poet, however trivial,
can be otherwise than interesting. 'We knew him well.' At Mr. Murray's
dinner-table the annotator met him and Sir John Malcolm. Lord Byron
talked of intending to travel in Persia. 'What must I do when I set
off?' said he to Sir John. 'Cut off your buttons!' 'My buttons! what,
these metal ones?' 'Yes; the Persians are in the main very honest
fellows; but if you go thus bedizened, you will infallibly be murdered
for your buttons.' At a dinner at Monk Lewis's chambers in the Albany,
Lord Byron expressed to the writer his determination not to go there
again, adding, 'I never will dine with a middle-aged man who fills
up his table with young ensigns, and has looking-glass panels to his
book-cases.' Lord Byron, when one of the Drury Lane Committee of
Management, challenged the writer to sing alternately (like the swains
in Virgil) the praises of Mrs. Mardyn, the actress, who, by the by, was
hissed off the stage for an imputed intimacy, of which she was quite
innocent.</p>

<p>The contest ran as follows:</p>

  <div class="poetry-container">
    <div class="poetry">
      <div class="stanza">
        <div class="ileft">'Wake, muse of fire, your ardent lyre,</div>
        <div class="i1">Pour forth your amorous ditty,</div>
        <div>But first profound, in duty bound,</div>
        <div class="i1">Applaud the new committee;</div>
        <div>Their scenic art from Thespis cart</div>
        <div class="i1">All jaded nags discarding,</div>
        <div>To London drove this queen of love,</div>
        <div class="i1">Enchanting Mrs. Mardyn.</div>
      </div>

    <div class="stanza">
        <div class="ileft">'Though tides of love around her rove,</div>
        <div class="i1">I fear she'll choose Pactolus&mdash;</div>
        <div>In that bright surge bards ne'er immerge,</div>
        <div class="i1">So I must e'en swim solus.</div>
        <div>"Out, out, alas!" ill-fated gas,</div>
        <div class="i1">That shin'st round Covent Garden,</div>
        <div>Thy ray how flat, compared with that</div>
        <div class="i1">From eye of Mrs. Mardyn!'</div>
    </div>
    </div>
  </div>

<p>And so on. The reader has, no doubt, already discovered 'which is the
justice, and which is the thief.'</p>

<p>Lord Byron at that time wore a very narrow cravat of white sarsnet,
with the shirt-collar falling over it; a black coat and waistcoat,
and very broad white trousers, to hide his lame foot&mdash;these were of
Russia duck in the morning, and jean in the evening. His watch-chain
had a number of small gold seals appended to it, and was looped up to
a button of his waistcoat. His face was void of colour; he wore no
whiskers. His eyes were grey, fringed with long black lashes; and his
air was imposing, but rather supercilious. He undervalued David Hume;
denying his claim to genius on account of his bulk, and calling him,
from the heroic epistle,</p>

  <div class="poetry-container">
    <div class="poetry">
      <div class="stanza">
        <div>'The fattest hog in Epicurus' sty.'</div>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>

<p>One of this extraordinary man's allegations was, that 'fat is an oily
dropsy.' To stave off its visitation, he frequently chewed tobacco in
lieu of dinner, alleging that it absorbed the gastric juice of the
stomach, and prevented hunger. 'Pass your hand down my side,' said his
lordship to the writer; 'can you count my ribs?' 'Every one of them.'
'I am delighted to hear you say so. I called last week on Lady&mdash;&mdash;;
"Ah, Lord Byron," said she, "how fat you grow!" But you know Lady&mdash;&mdash;
is fond of saying spiteful things!' Let this gossip be summed up with
the words of Lord Chesterfield, in his character of Bolingbroke: 'Upon
the whole, on a survey of this extraordinary character, what can we say
but "Alas, poor human nature!"'</p>

<p>His favourite Pope's description of man is applicable to Byron
individually:</p>

  <div class="poetry-container">
    <div class="poetry">
      <div class="stanza">
        <div class="ileft">'Chaos of thought and passion all confused,</div>
        <div>Still by himself abused or disabused;</div>
        <div>Created part to rise and part to fall,</div>
        <div>Great lord of all things, yet a slave to all;</div>
        <div>Sole judge of truth, in endless error hurled&mdash;</div>
        <div>The glory, jest, and riddle of the world.'</div>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>

<p>The writer never heard him allude to his deformed foot except upon one
occasion, when, entering the green-room of Drury Lane, he found Lord
Byron alone, the younger Byrne and Miss Smith the dancer having just
left him, after an angry conference about a <i>pas seul</i>. 'Had you been
here a minute sooner,' said Lord B., 'you would have heard a question
about dancing referred to me;&mdash;me! (looking mournfully downward) whom
fate from my birth has prohibited from taking a single step.'</p></div>

<p><a name="Footnote_11_11" id="Footnote_11_11"></a><a href="#FNanchor_11_11"><span class="label">[11]</span></a> 'Holland's edifice.' The late theatre was built by
Holland the architect. The writer visited it on the night of its
opening. The performances were <i>Macbeth</i> and the <i>Virgin Unmasked</i>.
Between the play and the farce, an excellent epilogue, written by
George Colman, was excellently spoken by Miss Farren. It referred
to the iron curtain which was, in the event of fire, to be let down
between the stage and the audience, and which accordingly descended,
by way of experiment, leaving Miss Farren between the lamps and the
curtain. The fair speaker informed the audience, that should the fire
break out on the stage (where it usually originates), it would thus be
kept from the spectators; adding, with great solemnity&mdash;</p>

in the course of the evening of Sir James Mackintosh as to what the

<p><a name="Footnote_27_27" id="Footnote_27_27"></a><a href="#FNanchor_27_27"><span class="label">[27]</span></a> O. P. This personage, who is alleged to have growled like
a bull-dog, requires rather a lengthened note, for the edification
of the rising generation. The 'horns, rattles, drums,' with which he
is accompanied, are no inventions of the poet. The new Covent Garden
Theatre opened on the 18th Sept., 1809, when a cry of 'Old Prices'
(afterwards diminished to O. P.) burst out from every part of the
house. This continued and increased in violence till the 23rd, when
rattles, drums, whistles, and cat-calls, having completely drowned
the voices of the actors, Mr. Kemble, the stage-manager, came forward
and said, that a committee of gentlemen had undertaken to examine the
finances of the concern, and that until they were prepared with their
report the theatre would continue closed. 'Name them!' was shouted
from all sides. The names were declared, viz. Sir Charles Price, the
Solicitor-General, the Recorder of London, the Governor of the Bank,
and Mr. Angersteen. 'All shareholders!' bawled a wag from the gallery.
In a few days the theatre re-opened: the public paid no attention to
the report of the referees, and the tumult was renewed for several
weeks with even increased violence. The proprietors now sent in hired
bruisers, to <i>mill</i> the refractory into subjection. This irritated most
of their former friends, and, amongst the rest, the annotator, who
accordingly wrote the song of 'Heigh-ho, says Kemble,' which was caught
up by the ballad-singers, and sung under Mr. Kemble's house-windows
in Great Russell Street. A dinner was given at the Crown and Anchor
Tavern in the Strand, to celebrate the victory obtained by W. Clifford
in his action against Brandon the box-keeper, for assaulting him
for wearing the letters O. P. in his hat. At this dinner Mr. Kemble
attended, and matters were compromised by allowing the advanced price
(seven shillings) to the boxes. The writer remembers a former riot of a
similar sort at the same theatre (in the year 1792), when the price to
the boxes was raised from five shillings to six. That tumult, however,
only lasted three nights.</p></div>

image is not the creation of the poets: it sprang from reality. The
Authors happened to be at the Royal Circus when 'God save the King'
was called for, accompanied by a cry of 'Stand up!' and 'Hats off!' An
inebriated naval lieutenant perceiving a gentleman in an adjoining box
slow to obey the call, struck his hat off with his stick, exclaiming,
'Take off your hat, sir!' The other thus assaulted proved to be,
unluckily for the lieutenant, Lord Camelford, the celebrated bruiser
and duellist. A set-to in the lobby was the consequence, where his
lordship quickly proved victorious. 'The devil is not so black as
he is painted,' said one of the Authors to the other; 'let us call
upon Lord Camelford, and tell him that we were witnesses of his
being first assaulted.' The visit was paid on the ensuing morning at
Lord Camelford's lodging, in Bond Street. Over the fire-place in the
drawing-room were ornaments strongly expressive of the pugnacity of the
peer. A long thick bludgeon lay horizontally supported by two brass
hooks. Above this was placed parallel one of lesser dimensions, until a
pyramid of weapons gradually arose, tapering to a horsewhip:</p>

  <div class="poetry-container">

        <div>'Thus all below was strength, and all above was grace.'</div>

    </div>
  </div>

<p>Lord Camelford received his visitants with great civility, and
thanked them warmly for the call; adding, that their evidence would
be material, it being his intention to indict the lieutenant for an
assault. 'All I can say in return is this,' exclaimed the peer with
great cordiality, 'if ever I see you engaged in a row, upon my soul,
I'll stand by you.' The Authors expressed themselves thankful for so
potent an ally, and departed. In about a fortnight afterwards Lord
Camelford was shot in a duel with Mr. Best.</p></div>

barricado," and its knocker and bell its "frappant and tintinnabulant
appendages," is neither just nor humorous; and we are surprised that
a writer who has given such extraordinary proofs of his talent for
finer ridicule and fairer imitation, should have stooped to a vein of
pleasantry so low, and so long ago exhausted; especially as, in other

specious, but untenable; that which it defends has since been abandoned
as impracticable. Mr. Whitbread contended that the actor was like a
portrait in a picture, and accordingly placed the green curtain in a
gilded frame remote from the foot-lights; alleging that no performer
should mar the illusion by stepping out of the frame. Dowton was the
first actor who, like Manfred's ancestor in the <i>Castle of Otranto</i>,
took the liberty of abandoning the canon. 'Don't tell me of frames
and pictures,' ejaculated the testy comedian; 'if I can't be heard by
the audience in the frame, I'll walk out of it!' The proscenium has
since been new-modelled, and the actors thereby brought nearer to the
audience.</p></div>

Monk Lewis, from his once popular romance of that name. He was
a good-hearted man, and, like too many of that fraternity, a
disagreeable one&mdash;verbose, disputatious, and paradoxical. His <i>Monk</i>
and <i>Castle Spectre</i> elevated him into fame; and he continued to write
ghost-stories till, following as he did in the wake of Mrs. Radcliffe,
he quite overstocked the market. Lewis visited his estates in Jamaica,
and came back perfectly negro-bitten. He promulgated a new code of
laws in the island, for the government of his sable subjects: one may
serve for a specimen: 'Any slave who commits murder shall have his head
shaved, and be confined three days and nights in a dark room.' Upon
occasion of printing these parodies, Monk Lewis said to Lady H., 'Many
of them are very fair, but mine is not at all like; they have made me
write burlesque, which I never do.' 'You don't know your own talent,'
answered the lady.</p>

<p>Lewis aptly described himself, as to externals, in the verses affixed
to his <i>Monk</i>, as having</p>

<p class="p-left">He had, moreover, large grey eyes, thick features, and an inexpressive
countenance. In talking, he had a disagreeable habit of drawing the
fore-finger of his right hand across his right eyelid. He affected, in
conversation, a sort of dandified, drawling tone; young Harlowe, the
artist, did the same. A foreigner who had but a slight knowledge of
the English language might have concluded, from their cadences, that
they were little better than fools&mdash;'just a born goose,' as Terry the
actor used to say. Lewis died on his passage homeward from Jamaica,
owing to a dose of James's powders injudiciously administered by 'his
own mere motion.' He wrote various plays, with various success: he had
an admirable notion of dramatic construction, but the goodness of his
scenes and incidents was marred by the badness of his dialogue.</p></div>

first place illumined by it was the Carlton House side of Pall Mall;
the second, Bishopsgate Street. The writer attended a lecture given
by the inventor: the charge of admittance was three shillings, but,
as the inventor was about to apply to parliament, members of both
houses were admitted gratis. The writer and a fellow-jester assumed
the parts of senators at a short notice. 'Members of parliament!' was
their important ejaculation at the door of entrance. 'What places,
gentlemen?' 'Old Sarum and Bridgewater.' 'Walk in, gentlemen.' Luckily,
the real Simon Pures did not attend. This Pall Mall illumination was
further noticed in <i>Horace in London</i>:&mdash;</p>

to the untheatrical portion of the community, which may now be said to
be all the world except the actors. Ticket-nights are those whereon the
inferior actors club for a benefit: each distributes as many tickets of
admission as he is able among his friends. A motley assemblage is the
consequence; and as each actor is encouraged by his own set, who are
not in general play-going people, the applause comes (as Chesterfield
says of Pope's attempts at wit) 'generally unseasonably and too often
unsuccessfully.'</p></div>

interview with this poet, who may be designated Pope in worsted
stockings, took place at William Spencer's villa at Petersham, close to
what that gentleman called his gold-fish pond, though it was scarcely
three feet in diameter, throwing up a <i>jet d'eau</i> like a thread. The
venerable bard, seizing both the hands of his satirist, exclaimed, with
a good-humoured laugh: 'Ah! my old enemy, how do you do?' In the course
of conversation, he expressed great astonishment at his popularity
in London; adding, 'In my own village they think nothing of me.' The
subject happening to be the inroads of Time upon Beauty, the writer
quoted the following lines:&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poetry-container">
    <div class="poetry">
      <div class="stanza">
        <div class="ileft">'Six years had pass'd, and forty ere the six,</div>
        <div>When Time began to play his usual tricks:</div>
        <div>My locks, once comely in a virgin's sight,</div>
        <div>Locks of pure brown, now felt th' encroaching white;</div>
        <div>Gradual each day I liked my horses less,</div>
        <div>My dinner more&mdash;I learnt to play at chess.'</div>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>

<p>'That's very good!' cried the bard;&mdash;'whose is it?' 'Your own.'
'Indeed! hah! well, I had quite forgotten it.' Was this affectation, or
was it not? In sooth, he seemed to push simplicity to puerility. This
imitation contained in manuscript the following lines, after describing
certain Sunday-newspaper critics who were supposed to be present at a
new play, and who were rather heated in their politics:&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poetry-container">
    <div class="poetry">
      <div class="stanza">
        <div class="ileft">'Hard is his task who edits&mdash;thankless job!</div>
        <div>A Sunday journal for the factious mob:</div>
        <div>With bitter paragraph and caustic jest,</div>
        <div>He gives to turbulence the day of rest;</div>
        <div>Condemn'd, this week, rash rancour to instil,</div>
        <div>Or thrown aside, the next, for one who will:</div>
        <div>Alike undone or if he praise or rail</div>
        <div>(For this affects his safety, that his sale),</div>
        <div>He sinks at last, in luckless limbo set,</div>
        <div>If loud for libel, and if dumb for debt.'</div>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>

<p>They were, however, never printed; being, on reflection, considered too
serious for the occasion.</p>

<p>It is not a little extraordinary that Crabbe, who could write with such
vigour, should descend to such lines as the following:&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poetry-container">
    <div class="poetry">
      <div class="stanza">
        <div class="ileft">'Something had happen'd wrong about a bill</div>

Cobbett and Peter use the same language for a different purpose:
Peter is indeed a sort of metrical Cobbett. Cobbett is, however,

the other only makes a bad one ridiculous and odious. If either Peter
Cobbett should see this note, each will feel more indignation at

<p class="p-left">There were several more verses, and being set to a very taking air, it
was a reigning favourite with the 'Social Chucksters' of the day. Even
scholars thought it worth turning into Latin verse. I remember reading
in some short-lived journal a very clever version of it, the first
verse of which ran thus:</p>

<p>Allusions to the willow, as an emblem of grief, are of a very old date.
'Sing all, a green willow must be my garland,' is the refrain of the
song which haunted Desdemona on the eve of her death (<i>Othello</i>, Act
IV., Scene 3). That exquisite scene, and the beautiful air to which
some contemporary of Shakespeare wedded it, will make 'The Willow Song'
immortal.</p></div>

about criminals of the time when these lines were written. Madame
Laffarge was convicted of poisoning her husband under extenuating
circumstances, and was imprisoned for life, but many believed in her
protestations of innocence&mdash;this, of course, she being a woman and
unhappily married. Daniel Good died on the scaffold on the 23rd of May,
1842, protesting his innocence to the last, and asserting that his
victim, Jane Sparks, had killed herself, an assertion which a judge and
jury naturally could not reconcile with the fact that her head, arms,
and legs had been cut off and hidden with her body in a stable. He,
too, found people to maintain that his sentence was unjust.</p></div>

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.

phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221; associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or

other than &#8220;Plain Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other format used in the official

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
